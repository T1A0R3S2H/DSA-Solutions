# Method 1 (brute force using stacks)

1. We create a stack `st` to simulate the push and pop operations.

2. We use an index `j` to keep track of our position in the `popped` array.

3. We iterate through each element `x` in the `pushed` array:
   - We push `x` onto the stack.
   - After each push, we check if the top of the stack matches the current element in `popped` (indexed by `j`).
   - If they match, we pop from the stack and increment `j`.
   - We continue this process as long as the stack is not empty, we haven't reached the end of `popped`, and the top of the stack matches the current element in `popped`.

4. After processing all elements in `pushed`, we check if we've successfully matched all elements in `popped` (i.e., if `j` equals the size of `popped`).

This solution efficiently simulates the push and pop operations, and correctly determines whether the given sequences are valid.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input arrays, as we process each element once. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, as the stack might contain all elements before starting to pop.
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool validateStackSequences(vector<int>& pushed, vector<int>& popped) {
        stack<int> st;
        int j=0;  // Index for popped array
        
        for (int x:pushed) {
            st.push(x);
            while (!st.empty() && j < popped.size() && st.top()==popped[j]) {
                st.pop();
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return j==popped.size();
    }
};
```
# Dry Run of validateStackSequences Algorithm

## Example 1:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]

Let's go through the algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize: stack `st` is empty, `j = 0`

2. Process `pushed` array:
   - Push 1: st = [1], j = 0
   - Push 2: st = [1,2], j = 0
   - Push 3: st = [1,2,3], j = 0
   - Push 4: st = [1,2,3,4], j = 0
     - Top matches popped[0], so pop: st = [1,2,3], j = 1
   - Push 5: st = [1,2,3,5], j = 1
     - Top matches popped[1], so pop: st = [1,2,3], j = 2
     - Top matches popped[2], so pop: st = [1,2], j = 3
     - Top matches popped[3], so pop: st = [1], j = 4
     - Top matches popped[4], so pop: st = [], j = 5

3. Check: j (5) == popped.size() (5), so return true

## Example 2:

Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]

Let's go through the algorithm step by step:

1. Initialize: stack `st` is empty, `j = 0`

2. Process `pushed` array:
   - Push 1: st = [1], j = 0
   - Push 2: st = [1,2], j = 0
   - Push 3: st = [1,2,3], j = 0
   - Push 4: st = [1,2,3,4], j = 0
     - Top matches popped[0], so pop: st = [1,2,3], j = 1
     - Top matches popped[1], so pop: st = [1,2], j = 2
   - Push 5: st = [1,2,5], j = 2
     - Top matches popped[2], so pop: st = [1,2], j = 3

3. Check: j (3) != popped.size() (5), so return false

In Example 1, we were able to simulate the entire sequence of push and pop operations successfully, ending with an empty stack and having processed all elements in both arrays. Therefore, the function returns true.

In Example 2, after processing all elements in the `pushed` array, we're left with elements in the stack that don't match the remaining elements in the `popped` array. Specifically, we can't pop 1 and 2 in the order required by the `popped` array. Therefore, the function returns false.
