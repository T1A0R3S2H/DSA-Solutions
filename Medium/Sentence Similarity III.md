        return words;
    }

    bool areSentencesSimilar(string sentence1, string sentence2) {

        vector<string> words2=split(sentence2);
        int n=words1.size();
        int m=words2.size();

        // Ensure that words1 is the shorter sentence
        if (n>m) {
            swap(words1, words2);
            swap(n, m);
        }

            pref++;
        }

        // common suffix
        int suff=0;
        while (suff<n && words1[n-1-suff]==words2[m-1-suff]) {
            suff++;
        }

### 1. **Explanation**

The goal is to determine if two sentences (`sentence1` and `sentence2`) are similar, meaning that one can become the other by inserting a sequence of words at either end. 

#### Key Steps:
- **Step 1: Split Sentences into Words**:  
   Each sentence is split into words and stored in vectors (`words1` and `words2`).
  
- **Step 2: Ensure the Shorter Sentence is First**:  
   We ensure that `words1` corresponds to the shorter sentence, and `words2` to the longer one by swapping if necessary. This simplifies the logic when checking the common prefix and suffix.

- **Step 3: Find the Common Prefix**:  
   Starting from the beginning, count how many words match between the two sentences until there's a mismatch. This gives the length of the **prefix**.

- **Step 4: Find the Common Suffix**:  
   Similarly, starting from the end, count how many words match between the two sentences. This gives the length of the **suffix**.

- **Step 5: Check for Sentence Similarity**:  
   The shorter sentence (`words1`) is considered similar to the longer one (`words2`) if the total number of common words (prefix + suffix) is greater than or equal to the length of the shorter sentence. This means the shorter sentence can fit entirely within the longer one with possible insertions between the prefix and suffix.

### 2. **Time Complexity**

Let:
- `n = length of the shorter sentence (words1)`
- `m = length of the longer sentence (words2)`

- **Splitting the sentences into words**:  
  - Splitting each sentence into words involves scanning each character of the sentence once. So, this step takes **O(n + m)**.

- **Prefix and Suffix Comparison**:  
  - The prefix and suffix comparisons each take up to **O(n)** (since the comparison stops once we reach the end of the shorter sentence).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**.

### 3. **Space Complexity**

- We use additional space to store the words from both sentences in vectors. 
  - The space used for `words1` is **O(n)**.
  - The space used for `words2` is **O(m)**.
  
Thus, the total space complexity is **O(n + m)**.

### 4. **Dry Run**

Let's do a dry run for an example to demonstrate how this solution works.

#### Example 1:
- **Input**:  
  `sentence1 = "My name is Haley"`  
  `sentence2 = "My Haley"`

- **Step 1: Split Sentences into Words**:  
  - `words1 = ["My", "name", "is", "Haley"]`
  - `words2 = ["My", "Haley"]`
  
- **Step 2: Ensure the Shorter Sentence is First**:  
  Since `words2` is shorter, we swap `words1` and `words2`, resulting in:
  - `words1 = ["My", "Haley"]` (shorter)
  - `words2 = ["My", "name", "is", "Haley"]` (longer)

- **Step 3: Find the Common Prefix**:  
  Compare from the start:
  - `words1[0] == words2[0]`: `"My" == "My"` → Match.
  - **Prefix length** = 1.

- **Step 4: Find the Common Suffix**:  
  Compare from the end:
  - `words1[1] == words2[3]`: `"Haley" == "Haley"` → Match.
  - **Suffix length** = 1.

- **Step 5: Check if the Shorter Sentence is Covered**:  
  - The total number of common words = `1 (prefix) + 1 (suffix) = 2`.
  - The length of the shorter sentence = `2`.
  - Since the total number of common words is equal to the length of the shorter sentence, we return **true**.

#### Example 2:
- **Input**:  
  `sentence1 = "Eating right now"`  
  `sentence2 = "Eating"`

- **Step 1: Split Sentences into Words**:  
  - `words1 = ["Eating", "right", "now"]`
  - `words2 = ["Eating"]`

- **Step 2: Ensure the Shorter Sentence is First**:  
  Since `words2` is shorter, we swap `words1` and `words2`, resulting in:
  - `words1 = ["Eating"]` (shorter)
  - `words2 = ["Eating", "right", "now"]` (longer)

- **Step 3: Find the Common Prefix**:  
  Compare from the start:
  - `words1[0] == words2[0]`: `"Eating" == "Eating"` → Match.
  - **Prefix length** = 1.

- **Step 4: Find the Common Suffix**:  
  There's no more word in `words1` to compare for the suffix, so the **suffix length** = 0.

- **Step 5: Check if the Shorter Sentence is Covered**:  
  - The total number of common words = `1 (prefix) + 0 (suffix) = 1`.
  - The length of the shorter sentence = `1`.
  - Since the total number of common words is equal to the length of the shorter sentence, we return **true**.
