### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isCompleteTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int size=countNodes(root);  // Calculate the size of the tree
        return isCBT(root, 0, size);  // Start with index 0
    }

    bool isCBT(TreeNode* root, int i, int size) {
        if (root==nullptr)
            return true;
        if (i>=size)
            return false;
        return isCBT(root->left, 2*i+1, size) &&
               isCBT(root->right, 2*i+2, size);
    }

    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root==nullptr)
            return 0;
        return 1+countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right);
    }
};

```
### Explanation:
The given code determines if a binary tree is a **Complete Binary Tree (CBT)**. A binary tree is considered complete if all levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which should be filled from left to right.

- **`countNodes` function**: This function counts the total number of nodes in the binary tree. It does so by recursively visiting each node and summing the counts of the left and right subtrees plus one (for the current node).

- **`isCBT` function**: This recursive function checks whether the tree satisfies the CBT property. It checks the following conditions:
  1. If the current node (`root`) is `nullptr`, return `true` since an empty tree is considered complete.
  2. If the current index (`i`) is greater than or equal to the total number of nodes (`size`), it implies that the tree is not complete because the current node is out of the valid range.
  3. Recursively check the left and right subtrees using the indices `2*i + 1` (left child) and `2*i + 2` (right child).

- **`isCompleteTree` function**: This is the main function that first calculates the total number of nodes in the tree using `countNodes` and then checks if the tree is complete by calling `isCBT` starting from index `0`.

### Time Complexity:
- **`countNodes`**: The function traverses each node exactly once, so its time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **`isCBT`**: This function also visits each node once, so its time complexity is `O(n)`.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n)` + `O(n)` = `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is mainly due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the depth of the recursion stack could be `O(n)`. 
- **Overall Space Complexity**: `O(n)`.

### Dry Run:

Consider the following tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

**Step-by-Step Execution**:

1. **countNodes(root)**:
   - Start at node `1`, recursively count nodes in left and right subtrees.
   - Left Subtree (`2`):
     - Left Subtree (`4`): `countNodes(4)` = 1 (leaf node)
     - Right Subtree (`5`): `countNodes(5)` = 1 (leaf node)
     - `countNodes(2)` = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
   - Right Subtree (`3`): `countNodes(3)` = 1 (leaf node)
   - `countNodes(1)` = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5.
   - The size of the tree is `5`.

2. **isCBT(root, 0, 5)**:
   - Start at node `1` (index `0`).
     - Left Child (`2`, index `1`): Check left and right children.
       - Left Child (`4`, index `3`): Both left and right are `nullptr`, return `true`.
       - Right Child (`5`, index `4`): Both left and right are `nullptr`, return `true`.
       - `isCBT(2)` returns `true`.
     - Right Child (`3`, index `2`): Both left and right are `nullptr`, return `true`.
   - `isCBT(1)` returns `true`.

**Result**: The tree is a complete binary tree, so `isCompleteTree(root)` returns `true`.
