        int n=nodes.size();
        for (int i=0; i<n-1; ++i) {
            nodes[i]->left=nullptr;
            nodes[i]->right=nodes[i+1];
        }
        
        // The last node should point to nullptr

    void preorder(TreeNode* root, vector<TreeNode*>& nodes) {
        if (root==nullptr) return;

        preorder(root->right, nodes);
    }
};
```

Let's break down the code step by step, analyze its time and space complexity, and do a dry run to understand how it works.

### Explanation:

1. **Flatten Function:**
   - This function flattens a binary tree into a linked list in place using pre-order traversal.
   - It uses a vector `nodes` to store pointers to the nodes of the tree in pre-order sequence.
   - After collecting all the nodes in the vector, it iterates through the vector and adjusts the pointers to flatten the tree:
     - Each node's `left` child is set to `nullptr`.
     - Each node's `right` child is set to point to the next node in the pre-order sequence.

2. **Pre-order Function:**
   - This is a recursive function that performs a pre-order traversal of the tree.
   - During traversal, it stores each node pointer in the `nodes` vector.

### Time Complexity (TC):

- **Pre-order Traversal:** The `preorder` function visits each node exactly once. The time complexity for this traversal is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Flattening the Tree:** After collecting the nodes, the `flatten` function iterates through the vector to set up the links. This loop runs \(N-1\) times, which is also \(O(N)\).
  
Overall, the time complexity is \(O(N)\).

### Space Complexity (SC):

- **Space for the Vector:** The vector `nodes` stores pointers to all \(N\) nodes in the tree, so it requires \(O(N)\) extra space.
- **Call Stack:** The maximum depth of the recursion is the height of the tree, which in the worst case (for a skewed tree) can be \(O(N)\). However, this space is typically not considered in space complexity when focusing on auxiliary space.

Overall, the space complexity is \(O(N)\).

### Dry Run:

Let's dry run the code with a sample tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
```

1. **Initial Call:** `flatten(root)` is called with `root` pointing to node `1`.
2. **Pre-order Traversal:**
   - Start with `root = 1`. Add `1` to the vector.
   - Move to `root->left = 2`. Add `2` to the vector.
   - Move to `root->left->left = 3`. Add `3` to the vector.
   - Since `3` has no children, backtrack to `2` and move to `root->left->right = 4`. Add `4` to the vector.
   - Backtrack to `1` and move to `root->right = 5`. Add `5` to the vector.
   - Move to `root->right->right = 6`. Add `6` to the vector.
   - The vector now contains: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
   
3. **Flatten the Tree:**
   - Iterate over the vector:
     - Set `1->left = nullptr` and `1->right = 2`.
     - Set `2->left = nullptr` and `2->right = 3`.
     - Set `3->left = nullptr` and `3->right = 4`.
     - Set `4->left = nullptr` and `4->right = 5`.
     - Set `5->left = nullptr` and `5->right = 6`.
     - Set `6->left = nullptr` and `6->right = nullptr`.

4. **Final Tree Structure:**
   - The tree is now a right-skewed linked list:
   ```
   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6
   ```

### Summary:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\)
- **Dry Run:** The process successfully transforms the binary tree into a flattened linked list following the pre-order traversal sequence.
