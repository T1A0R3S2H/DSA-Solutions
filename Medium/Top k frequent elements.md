### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> topKFrequent(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        for (int num:nums) {
            freq[num]++;
        }

        // Create a max heap to store the frequencies
        priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq;
        for (auto& [num, count]:freq) {
            pq.push({count, num});
        }

        // Create a vector to store the top k frequent elements
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i=0; i<k; i++) {
            result.push_back(pq.top().second);
            pq.pop();
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
### Explanation

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - The code starts by creating an `unordered_map<int, int> freq` to count the frequency of each element in the input vector `nums`.
   - It iterates through each element in `nums`, incrementing the count of each element in the `freq` map.

2. **Max Heap Construction**:
   - A `priority_queue<pair<int, int>> pq` is used as a max heap to store pairs of `(frequency, number)`.
   - The code iterates through the `freq` map, pushing each `(count, num)` pair into the max heap. This makes the heap prioritize elements with higher frequencies.

3. **Extracting Top K Frequent Elements**:
   - A `vector<int> result` is created to store the top `k` frequent elements.
   - The code pops the top `k` elements from the max heap (which are the elements with the highest frequencies) and pushes the `second` part of each pair (the number itself) into the `result` vector.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - The `result` vector containing the `k` most frequent elements is returned.

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Count**: Building the frequency map takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.

2. **Heap Operations**:
   - Inserting all unique elements into the heap takes `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of unique elements (since each insertion operation in a heap is `O(log m)`).
   - Extracting `k` elements from the heap takes `O(k log m)`, where `k <= m`.

   Since `m` (the number of unique elements) is generally less than `n`, the dominant factor here is `O(n + m log m)`. In the worst case where all elements are unique, `m` would be `n`, and this would become `O(n log n)`.

### Space Complexity

1. **Frequency Map**: The `freq` map requires `O(m)` space to store the frequency of each unique element.

2. **Max Heap**: The `priority_queue` also requires `O(m)` space to store pairs for each unique element.

3. **Result Vector**: The `result` vector requires `O(k)` space to store the top `k` frequent elements.

   Overall, the space complexity is `O(m)` due to the storage of unique elements in both the map and the heap.

### Dry Run

Let's do a dry run of the code using the example `nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]` and `k = 2`.

1. **Input**:
   - `nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`
   - `k = 2`

2. **Step 1: Frequency Map**:
   - Iterating over `nums`, we get `freq = {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1}`.

3. **Step 2: Max Heap Construction**:
   - Inserting each `(count, num)` pair into the heap:
     - Push `(3, 1)`, heap now: `[(3, 1)]`
     - Push `(2, 2)`, heap now: `[(3, 1), (2, 2)]`
     - Push `(1, 3)`, heap now: `[(3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3)]`
   - The heap is sorted based on the first element of each pair (frequency).

4. **Step 3: Extracting Top K Frequent Elements**:
   - Pop the top element from the heap `k` times:
     - First pop: `(3, 1)`, result becomes `[1]`, heap now: `[(2, 2), (1, 3)]`
     - Second pop: `(2, 2)`, result becomes `[1, 2]`, heap now: `[(1, 3)]`

5. **Step 4: Return Result**:
   - The final result is `[1, 2]`.

### Summary

- The corrected code correctly identifies and returns the `k` most frequent elements using a max heap.
- The use of a `priority_queue` allows efficiently finding the `k` most frequent elements by leveraging heap properties.
- The time and space complexities are appropriate for handling the problem's constraints, ensuring that the code runs efficiently for larger input sizes.
