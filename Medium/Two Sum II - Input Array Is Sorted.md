## Method 1
Here's how the code works:

- We initialize two pointers, left and right, pointing to the start and end of the numbers array, respectively.
- We enter a loop where we move the left and right pointers towards each other, checking the sum of the elements at those pointers:

- If the sum is equal to the target, we return the indices (adding 1 since the indices are 1-indexed).
- If the sum is less than the target, we increment left to increase the sum.
- If the sum is greater than the target, we decrement right to decrease the sum.


Since the problem statement **guarantees** that there is exactly one solution, we don't need to handle the case where the loop terminates without finding a solution.
##
**This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the numbers array, since we only need to iterate through the array once in the worst case. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using constant extra space, as required by the problem statement.**
##
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = numbers.size() - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];
            if (sum == target) {
                // Since the indices are 1-indexed, we add 1 to left and right
                return {left + 1, right + 1};
            } else if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        // This line should never be reached since the problem statement
        // guarantees that there is exactly one solution
        return {};
    }
};
```


## Method 2 (Extension of Method 1)
Here's how the code works:

- We initialize an empty stack s and an empty vector result to store the result.
- We use two nested loops to iterate through all pairs of indices i and j in the numbers array, where j > i.
- For each pair i and j, we check if the sum of numbers[i] and numbers[j] is equal to the target.
- If the sum is equal to the target, we push the 1-indexed indices i + 1 and j + 1 onto the stack s.
- We then pop the two indices from the stack and store them in the result vector.
- Finally, we return the result vector containing the two indices.
Since the problem statement guarantees that there is exactly one solution, we don't need to handle the case where the loop terminates without finding a solution.
##
This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the length of the numbers array, since we are using nested loops to check all pairs of indices. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using constant extra space for the stack and the result vector.
Note that this solution using a stack is less efficient than the two-pointer solution we discussed earlier, which has a time complexity of O(n). However, if you specifically need to use a stack-based approach, this implementation will work.
##
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        stack<int> s;
        vector<int> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.size(); j++) {
                if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target) {
                    s.push(i + 1); // Push the 1-indexed indices to the stack
                    s.push(j + 1);
                    
                    result.push_back(s.top()); // Add the indices to the result vector
                    s.pop();
                    result.push_back(s.top());
                    s.pop();
                    
                    return result; // Return the result vector
                }
            }
        }
        
        // This line should never be reached since the problem statement
        // guarantees that there is exactly one solution
        return {};
    }
};
```
