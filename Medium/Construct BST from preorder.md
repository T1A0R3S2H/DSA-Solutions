### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* bstFromPreorder(vector<int>& preorder) {
        return constructBST(preorder, 0, preorder.size() - 1);
    }
    
private:
    TreeNode* constructBST(vector<int>& preorder, int start, int end) {
        if (start>end) {
            return nullptr; // if the current subarray is empty, return nullptr
        }

        TreeNode* root=new TreeNode(preorder[start]); // first element is the root
        
        // Find the first element greater than the root to divide left and right subtrees
        int rightSubtreeStart=start+1;
        while (rightSubtreeStart<=end && preorder[rightSubtreeStart]<root->val) {
            rightSubtreeStart++;
        }
        
        // Recursively construct the left and right subtrees
        root->left = constructBST(preorder, start + 1, rightSubtreeStart - 1);
        root->right = constructBST(preorder, rightSubtreeStart, end);
        return root;
    }
};
```
### **Explanation**

The code uses the property of BST and preorder traversal to construct the tree:

1. **Preorder Property**: The first element of the preorder traversal is the root. For the subsequent elements, those smaller than the root will be in the left subtree, and those greater will be in the right subtree.
2. **Recursive Construction**:
   - Start by creating the root node using the first element.
   - Use a pointer to find the boundary between the left and right subtrees. The left subtree contains all elements smaller than the root, and the right subtree contains all elements larger.
   - Recursively apply this process to construct the left and right subtrees.
   
### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) in the worst case:
  - **Worst-case scenario**: This happens when the tree is skewed (either left-skewed or right-skewed), such as when the input list is sorted. In this case, each recursive call has to traverse the entire remaining list to find the start of the right subtree, resulting in quadratic time complexity.
  - **Average-case scenario**: If the tree is balanced, each recursive call splits the problem into roughly two halves, leading to \( O(n \log n) \) time complexity.

### **Space Complexity Analysis**

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \):
  - This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, if the tree is skewed, the recursion depth will be \( n \) (the length of the input list). Each call adds a new frame to the stack, so in the worst case, the space complexity is \( O(n) \).

### **Dry Run**

Let's perform a dry run of the code using the input `preorder = [8, 5, 1, 7, 10, 12]`:

1. **Initial Call**: `constructBST(preorder, 0, 5)`
   - `root = 8` (first element)
   - Find `rightSubtreeStart`:
     - `5 < 8` (continue)
     - `1 < 8` (continue)
     - `7 < 8` (continue)
     - `10 > 8` (stop, `rightSubtreeStart = 4`)
   - Construct left subtree with range `[1, 3]` and right subtree with range `[4, 5]`.

2. **Left Subtree of 8**: `constructBST(preorder, 1, 3)`
   - `root = 5`
   - Find `rightSubtreeStart`:
     - `1 < 5` (continue)
     - `7 > 5` (stop, `rightSubtreeStart = 3`)
   - Construct left subtree with range `[2, 2]` and right subtree with range `[3, 3]`.

3. **Left Subtree of 5**: `constructBST(preorder, 2, 2)`
   - `root = 1` (only one element, so both left and right subtrees are `nullptr`).
   - Return `TreeNode(1)`.

4. **Right Subtree of 5**: `constructBST(preorder, 3, 3)`
   - `root = 7` (only one element, so both left and right subtrees are `nullptr`).
   - Return `TreeNode(7)`.

5. **Right Subtree of 8**: `constructBST(preorder, 4, 5)`
   - `root = 10`
   - Find `rightSubtreeStart`:
     - `12 > 10` (stop, `rightSubtreeStart = 5`)
   - Construct left subtree with range `[5, 4]` (invalid range, returns `nullptr`) and right subtree with range `[5, 5]`.

6. **Right Subtree of 10**: `constructBST(preorder, 5, 5)`
   - `root = 12` (only one element, so both left and right subtrees are `nullptr`).
   - Return `TreeNode(12)`.

### **Resulting Tree Structure**

The resulting BST constructed from `preorder = [8, 5, 1, 7, 10, 12]` will be:

```
       8
     /   \
    5     10
   / \      \
  1   7     12
```

- The root node is `8`.
- `5` is the left child of `8`, with `1` and `7` as its children.
- `10` is the right child of `8`, with `12` as its right child.

This tree matches the preorder sequence and adheres to BST properties, ensuring all left descendants are less than the node and all right descendants are greater.
