### **Code**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dfs(int node, vector<int>& visited, vector<int> adj[], vector<bool>& hasApple) {
        visited[node]=1;
        int totalTime=0;
        for (auto& it:adj[node]) {
            // adjacent nodes
            if (!visited[it]) {
                int childTime=dfs(it, visited, adj, hasApple); // using recursion, call DFS on the adjacent node
                // agar child node has apples or it takes time to collect apples from children
                if (childTime>0 || hasApple[it]) {
                    totalTime+=childTime+2; // aana + jana
                }
            }
        }
        return totalTime;
    }

    int minTime(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges, vector<bool>& hasApple) {
        vector<int> adj[n]; // make adjacency list
        for (const auto& edge:edges) {

            // since undirected graph
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        vector<int> visited(n, 0); // To keep track of visited nodes
        return dfs(0, visited, adj, hasApple); // Start DFS from node 0
    }
};

```
### **Explanation**

1. **Tree Representation**:
    - The input tree is represented using an adjacency list (`vector<int> adj[n]`). Each node is connected by undirected edges.
    - The function `minTime` initializes this adjacency list using the given `edges`.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal**:
    - The function `dfs` is used to perform DFS traversal starting from the root node (node 0).
    - It tracks visited nodes using the `visited` vector to avoid cycles and redundant traversals.
    - The `totalTime` variable accumulates the time spent collecting apples from child nodes and returning.

3. **Collecting Apples**:
    - For each child node, the `dfs` function recursively explores the tree.
    - If a child node has apples (`hasApple[it]`) or any of its descendant nodes have apples (`childTime > 0`), the time to traverse to and return from that node (`childTime + 2`) is added to `totalTime`.

4. **Returning Time**:
    - The root node does not add to `totalTime` since it's the starting point. However, it includes the time taken to visit each subtree that has apples.

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Building the Adjacency List**: \( O(n) \)
    - Since there are `n-1` edges, and each edge is processed once to build the adjacency list.

- **DFS Traversal**: \( O(n) \)
    - The `dfs` function is called once for each node, leading to a total traversal of `O(n)`.

- **Overall Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

### **Space Complexity Analysis**

- **Adjacency List**: \( O(n) \)
    - Stores `n` nodes and their edges.

- **Visited Array**: \( O(n) \)
    - Keeps track of whether each node has been visited.

- **Recursive Call Stack**: \( O(h) \)
    - `h` is the height of the tree, which can go up to `n` in the worst case (skewed tree).

- **Overall Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)

### **Dry Run**

Let's dry run the code with an example:

- **Input**:
    - `n = 7` (nodes are 0 to 6)
    - `edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]]`
    - `hasApple = [false, false, true, false, true, true, false]`

- **Adjacency List Construction**:
    - `adj = [[1, 2], [0, 4, 5], [0, 3, 6], [2], [1], [1], [2]]`

- **DFS Traversal**:
    - Start at `node 0`:
        - Visit `node 1`: no apple at 1 but check children.
            - Visit `node 4`: has apple.
                - `totalTime += 2` (to and fro for `node 4`)
            - Visit `node 5`: has apple.
                - `totalTime += 2` (to and fro for `node 5`)
        - `totalTime for node 1 = 4`
    - Continue with `node 0`:
        - Visit `node 2`: no apple at 2 but check children.
            - Visit `node 3`: no apple.
                - `totalTime = 0` (no addition)
            - Visit `node 6`: no apple.
                - `totalTime = 0` (no addition)
            - However, since `node 2` has a child `node 3` with an apple:
                - `totalTime += 2` (to and fro for `node 2`)
        - `totalTime for node 2 = 2`
    - `totalTime for node 0 = 4 (from node 1) + 2 (from node 2) = 6`

- **Output**:
    - The minimum time required to collect all apples is `6`.

### **Conclusion**

This code effectively utilizes DFS to traverse the tree and calculate the minimum time to collect apples, considering both nodes with apples and the necessary return paths. It leverages recursive traversal and checks conditions to ensure that unnecessary paths are not added to the total time.
