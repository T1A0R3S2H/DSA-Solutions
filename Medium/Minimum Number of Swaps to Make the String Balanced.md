## Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwaps(string s) {
        int unmatched=0;
        int swaps=0;
        for (char c:s) {
            if (c=='[') {
                unmatched++;
            } 
            else {  // c == ']'
                if (unmatched==0) {
                    swaps++;
                    unmatched++;
                } 
                else {
                    unmatched--;
                }
            }
        }
        return swaps;
    }
};
```
## Explanation:
The key insight of this solution is that we don't actually need to perform the swaps - we just need to count how many are necessary. We can do this by keeping track of the "balance" of brackets as we traverse the string.

1. We use `unmatched` to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets.
2. We use `swaps` to count the number of swaps needed.
3. As we iterate through the string:
   - For an opening bracket '[', we increment `unmatched`.
   - For a closing bracket ']':
     - If `unmatched` is 0, it means we have an extra closing bracket. We need a swap, so we increment `swaps`.
     - We also increment `unmatched` in this case, because we're effectively saying "we'll swap this ']' with a '[' later".
     - If `unmatched` is not 0, we can match this closing bracket with an opening bracket, so we decrement `unmatched`.
4. At the end, `swaps` gives us the minimum number of swaps needed.

## Time Complexity (TC):
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the string once, performing constant-time operations for each character.

## Space Complexity (SC):
The space complexity is O(1) or constant space. We only use two integer variables (`unmatched` and `swaps`) regardless of the input size.

## Dry Run:
Let's do a dry run with the example: s = "]]][[["





| Index | Character | unmatched | swaps | Explanation |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 0     | ]         | 1         | 1     | Extra ], need a swap |
| 1     | ]         | 2         | 2     | Extra ], need another swap |
| 2     | ]         | 3         | 3     | Extra ], need another swap |
| 3     | [         | 2         | 3     | Matched with previous ] |
| 4     | [         | 1         | 3     | Matched with previous ] |
| 5     | [         | 0         | 3     | Matched with previous ] |

Final result: 3 swaps needed


Explanation of the dry run:
1. We start with the first ']'. Since `unmatched` is 0, we need a swap. We increment both `swaps` and `unmatched`.
2. The same happens for the next two ']' characters.
3. When we reach the '[' characters, they start matching with the unmatched ']' we counted earlier, so we decrement `unmatched` each time.
4. At the end, `unmatched` is 0 (all brackets are matched) and `swaps` is 3.

This matches our intuition: we need to swap 3 pairs of brackets to balance the string ("]]][[["  ->  "[[][]]").

The dry run demonstrates how our algorithm correctly identifies the minimum number of swaps needed without actually performing the swaps or using any complex data structures.

Is there any part of this explanation you'd like me to elaborate on further?
