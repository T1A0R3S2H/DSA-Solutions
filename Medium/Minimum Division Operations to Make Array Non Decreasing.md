### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();  // Step 1: Get the size of the array.
        int ans = 0;          // Step 2: Initialize the operation count to 0.
        
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {  // Step 3: Iterate from the second last element to the first.
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {   // Step 4: Check if the current element is greater than the next.
                
                // Step 5: If so, find the greatest proper divisor (GPD).
                for (int j = 2; j * j <= nums[i]; j++) {  // Loop through possible divisors.
                    if (nums[i] % j == 0) {   // Step 6: If j is a divisor of nums[i].
                        nums[i] = j;          // Step 7: Update nums[i] to its GPD.
                        ans++;                // Step 8: Increment the operation count.
                        break;               // Step 9: Exit the loop after the first GPD is found.
                    }
                }
                
                // Step 10: Check again if the adjusted nums[i] is still greater than nums[i + 1].
                if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) return -1;  // Step 11: If it is, return -1 (impossible case).
            }
        }
        return ans;  // Step 12: Return the total number of operations performed.
    }
};
```

### Explanation
The code implements a solution to the problem of minimizing the number of operations required to make an array non-decreasing by dividing its elements by their greatest proper divisors. The algorithm iterates backward through the array, checking each element against the next. If it finds that the current element is greater, it finds the greatest proper divisor and updates the element. If, after modification, the condition is still violated, it returns -1. Otherwise, it counts the operations and proceeds.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n.sqrt(m)), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`, and \(m\) is the maximum value in `nums`. The outer loop runs \(n\) times, and the inner loop runs at most \(O(\sqrt{m})\) times for finding the greatest proper divisor.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Dry Run
**Example**: `nums = [10, 6, 4, 8, 7, 15]`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums = [10, 6, 4, 8, 7, 15]`
   - `n = 6`
   - `ans = 0`

**Iteration Steps**:
- **Iteration 1** (`i = 4`):
  - Check: `7 < 15` → No change.
- **Iteration 2** (`i = 3`):
  - Check: `8 > 7` → True.
  - GPD of `8`: Update `nums[3] = 2`, `ans = 1`.
  - Check: `2 > 7` → False.
- **Iteration 3** (`i = 2`):
  - Check: `4 > 2` → True.
  - GPD of `4`: Update `nums[2] = 2`, `ans = 2`.
  - Check: `2 > 2` → False.
- **Iteration 4** (`i = 1`):
  - Check: `6 > 2` → True.
  - GPD of `6`: Update `nums[1] = 2`, `ans = 3`.
  - Check: `2 > 2` → False.
- **Iteration 5** (`i = 0`):
  - Check: `10 > 2` → True.
  - GPD of `10`: Update `nums[0] = 2`, `ans = 4`.
  - Check: `2 > 2` → False.

### Final Output
The output is `4`, indicating that four operations are required to make the array non-decreasing.

### Conclusion
The algorithm efficiently reduces elements that violate the non-decreasing condition, ensuring that all adjustments are made correctly. It returns the minimum number of operations required or `-1` if it’s impossible to make the array non-decreasing.
