The given code is a solution to the "Subsets II" problem, which is a variation of the classic "Subsets" problem with the addition of handling duplicate elements in the input array. The approach used in this solution is a backtracking algorithm combined with a sorting technique to handle duplicates efficiently.

Here's a detailed explanation of the approach:

The `subsetsWithDup` function takes a vector of integers `nums` as input and returns a vector of vectors, containing all possible subsets of `nums`, including the empty subset. It starts by initializing an empty vector `ans` to store the subsets and an empty vector `ds` to store the current subset being constructed. It then sorts the input vector `nums` in ascending order to group duplicate elements together.

The actual backtracking process is handled by the `solve` function, which takes four parameters: `idx` (the current index in `nums`), `nums` (the input vector), `ans` (the vector to store subsets), and `ds` (the current subset being constructed).

The `solve` function first adds the current subset `ds` to the `ans` vector, as it is a valid subset. Then, it iterates through the remaining elements in `nums`, starting from the current index `idx`. For each element, it checks if the current element is a duplicate of the previous element (to avoid generating duplicate subsets). If it's a duplicate, it skips that element; otherwise, it adds the current element to the `ds` vector and recursively calls `solve` with the next index (`i+1`). After the recursive call, it removes the current element from `ds` using `ds.pop_back()`, effectively backtracking to explore other possibilities.

The use of `sort` and the check for duplicate elements (`if(i!=idx && nums[i]==nums[i-1]) continue;`) is crucial for handling duplicates. By sorting the input array, duplicate elements are grouped together, and the condition `i!=idx && nums[i]==nums[i-1]` ensures that only the first occurrence of a duplicate element is considered for inclusion in the subsets. This prevents the generation of duplicate subsets.

After the backtracking process is complete, the `ans` vector contains all the unique subsets of `nums`, including the empty subset, and it is returned as the final result.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of the input vector `nums`. This is because, in the worst case (no duplicates), the backtracking algorithm generates all 2^N subsets, and for each subset, it iterates through the entire input vector. The space complexity is O(N * 2^N) as well, as it stores all the generated subsets in the `ans` vector.
