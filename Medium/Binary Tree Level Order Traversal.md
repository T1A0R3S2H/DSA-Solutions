### Explanation:

The given code performs a level order traversal of a binary tree. This traversal visits nodes level by level from left to right.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Check if the Tree is Empty**: If the root is `nullptr`, return an empty vector since there are no nodes to traverse.
2. **Initialize the Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of nodes to be visited. Start by pushing the root node into the queue.
3. **Traverse Level by Level**:
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level (`levelSize`).
   - For each node at the current level, remove it from the queue, record its value, and add its children (if any) to the queue for the next level.
4. **Collect Results**: After processing all nodes at a level, store the collected values in the result vector.

### Time Complexity (TC) and Space Complexity (SC):

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(N)**: Each node is visited exactly once, where \( N \) is the number of nodes in the tree.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(N)**: In the worst case, the space required for the queue is proportional to the number of nodes at the last level, which can be up to \( N/2 \).

### Dry Run:

Let's dry run the code with the input `root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`.

#### Initial Tree Structure:
```
      3
     / \
    9   20
       /  \
      15   7
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `result = []`
   - `q = [3]` (root node)

2. **First Level**:
   - `levelSize = 1` (only the root node)
   - `currentLevel = []`
   - Process node `3`:
     - Add `3` to `currentLevel`: `currentLevel = [3]`
     - Push `9` and `20` to the queue: `q = [9, 20]`
   - Append `currentLevel` to `result`: `result = [[3]]`

3. **Second Level**:
   - `levelSize = 2` (nodes `9` and `20`)
   - `currentLevel = []`
   - Process node `9`:
     - Add `9` to `currentLevel`: `currentLevel = [9]`
     - `9` has no children, queue remains: `q = [20]`
   - Process node `20`:
     - Add `20` to `currentLevel`: `currentLevel = [9, 20]`
     - Push `15` and `7` to the queue: `q = [15, 7]`
   - Append `currentLevel` to `result`: `result = [[3], [9, 20]]`

4. **Third Level**:
   - `levelSize = 2` (nodes `15` and `7`)
   - `currentLevel = []`
   - Process node `15`:
     - Add `15` to `currentLevel`: `currentLevel = [15]`
     - `15` has no children, queue remains: `q = [7]`
   - Process node `7`:
     - Add `7` to `currentLevel`: `currentLevel = [15, 7]`
     - `7` has no children, queue is now empty: `q = []`
   - Append `currentLevel` to `result`: `result = [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`

5. **Completion**:
   - The queue is empty, so the traversal is complete.
   - Return `result`: `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`

### Final Code with Comments:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (root == nullptr) {
            return result;
        }
        
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size();
            vector<int> currentLevel;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                currentLevel.push_back(node->val);
                
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }
            
            result.push_back(currentLevel);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```
