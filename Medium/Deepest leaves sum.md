### Objective

The goal is to find the sum of the values of the deepest leaves in a binary tree.

### Approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

1. **Use a Queue for BFS**: 
   - We use a queue to traverse the tree level by level. BFS is ideal here because it processes all nodes at one level before moving to the next level.

2. **Initialize the Queue**:
   - Start by pushing the root node into the queue.

3. **Traverse Level by Level**:
   - While the queue is not empty, process all nodes at the current level. 
   - For each level, reset the sum to 0. This sum will accumulate the values of the nodes at the current level.
   - Determine the number of nodes at the current level (`size`).
   - For each node at this level, add its value to the sum and enqueue its children (if they exist).

4. **Result**:
   - After the BFS traversal, the `sum` will contain the sum of the values of the nodes at the deepest level.

### Detailed Explanation with Dry Run

Let's use an example to clarify:

**Input**: root = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, null, 6, 7, null, null, null, null, 8]`

This represents the following tree:

```
        1
      /   \
     2     3
    / \     \
   4   5     6
  /
 7
          \
           8
```

1. **Initialize the Queue**:
   - Queue: [1]
   - Sum: 0

2. **First Level**:
   - Size: 1 (Only the root node)
   - Process node 1:
     - Sum: 1
     - Enqueue its children: [2, 3]
   - Sum at this level: 1

3. **Second Level**:
   - Size: 2 (Nodes 2 and 3)
   - Process node 2:
     - Sum: 2
     - Enqueue its children: [3, 4, 5]
   - Process node 3:
     - Sum: 5
     - Enqueue its child: [4, 5, 6]
   - Sum at this level: 5

4. **Third Level**:
   - Size: 3 (Nodes 4, 5, and 6)
   - Process node 4:
     - Sum: 4
     - Enqueue its child: [5, 6, 7]
   - Process node 5:
     - Sum: 9
     - No children to enqueue
   - Process node 6:
     - Sum: 15
     - No children to enqueue
   - Sum at this level: 15

5. **Fourth Level**:
   - Size: 1 (Node 7)
   - Process node 7:
     - Sum: 7
     - Enqueue its child: [8]
   - Sum at this level: 7

6. **Fifth Level**:
   - Size: 1 (Node 8)
   - Process node 8:
     - Sum: 8
     - No children to enqueue
   - Sum at this level: 8

**Final Result**:
- The sum of the deepest leaves (level with nodes 8) is 8.

### Code Implementation

Here is the code again for clarity:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        
        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            sum = 0; // Reset the sum for the current level
            int size = q.size(); // Number of nodes at the current level
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                
                sum += node->val; // Add the node's value to the sum
                
                // Enqueue the children of the current node
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }
        }
        
        return sum; // The sum of the values of the nodes at the deepest level
    }
};
```

### Key Points

- **Breadth-First Search**: This ensures we process the tree level by level.
- **Sum Reset Each Level**: By resetting the sum at each level, we ensure that the sum variable only holds the sum of the deepest level's nodes by the end of the traversal.
- **Queue**: The queue helps in managing the nodes to be processed at each level efficiently.

This should help you understand the approach clearly. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
