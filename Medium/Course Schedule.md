### Explanation:

The problem is asking whether it's possible to finish all courses given some prerequisite dependencies between them. This problem can be reduced to detecting if there is a cycle in a directed graph where each node represents a course, and each directed edge represents a prerequisite relationship.

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each course is represented as a vertex.
   - A directed edge from course `bi` to course `ai` indicates that course `bi` must be taken before `ai`.
   
2. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If there is a cycle in the graph, it implies that there is a circular dependency, and it's impossible to complete the courses.
   - If there is no cycle, it's possible to finish all the courses.

### Algorithm:

1. **In-degree Calculation**: 
   - In a directed graph, the in-degree of a vertex is the number of incoming edges. We first calculate the in-degree for every vertex.
   
2. **Topological Sort using Kahn’s Algorithm**:
   - We use Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting, which processes vertices with in-degree `0` first (i.e., vertices that don't have any prerequisites).
   - If we can process all the vertices, it means there's no cycle; otherwise, there’s a cycle.

3. **Cycle Detection**:
   - If the number of processed vertices is equal to the total number of vertices, it means there's no cycle, and we can complete all courses.
   - If the count of processed vertices is less than the total number of vertices, it indicates the presence of a cycle.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity**: \( O(V + E) \)
  - \( V \) is the number of courses (`numCourses`).
  - \( E \) is the number of prerequisites (`prerequisites.size()`).
  - We iterate over all vertices to calculate in-degrees, and for each edge, we reduce the in-degree of the adjacent vertex, which takes linear time.
  
### Space Complexity:
- **Space complexity**: \( O(V + E) \)
  - The adjacency list takes \( O(V + E) \) space, where \( V \) is the number of vertices and \( E \) is the number of edges.
  - The `inedge` vector takes \( O(V) \) space.

### Dry Run:

#### Example 1:
- **Input**: `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]`
- **Explanation**:
   - Courses: 0 and 1.
   - To take course 1, you must first take course 0.
   - Graph: `0 -> 1`
   - In-degrees: `[0, 1]` (course 0 has in-degree 0, and course 1 has in-degree 1).
   - We enqueue course 0 (in-degree 0) and process it.
   - After processing course 0, the in-degree of course 1 becomes 0, so we enqueue course 1 and process it.
   - All courses are processed, meaning no cycle is present.
   - **Output**: `true`

#### Example 2:
- **Input**: `numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0], [0,1]]`
- **Explanation**:
   - Courses: 0 and 1.
   - There is a circular dependency: course 0 requires course 1, and course 1 requires course 0.
   - Graph: `0 -> 1` and `1 -> 0`.
   - In-degrees: `[1, 1]` (both courses have in-degree 1).
   - No course has in-degree 0, so nothing is enqueued.
   - Since no courses can be processed, a cycle is detected.
   - **Output**: `false`

### Code with Explanation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if there is a cycle using Kahn's algorithm
    bool isCyclic(int V, vector<int> adj[]) {
        vector<int> inedge(V, 0);  // Vector to store in-degrees of all vertices
        
        // Calculate in-degrees of all vertices
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            for (auto j : adj[i]) {
                inedge[j]++;
            }
        }
        
        queue<int> q;
        // Enqueue all vertices with in-degree 0
        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            if (inedge[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;  // To count the number of vertices processed
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int topNode = q.front();
            q.pop();
            count++;
            // Decrease the in-degree of adjacent vertices
            for (auto i : adj[topNode]) {
                inedge[i]--;
                // If in-degree becomes 0, enqueue the vertex
                if (inedge[i] == 0) {
                    q.push(i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If count is equal to V, no cycle is present
        return count != V;
    }

    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<int> adj[numCourses];  // Create an adjacency list
        
        // Build the graph from the prerequisites
        for (auto pre : prerequisites) {
            adj[pre[1]].push_back(pre[0]);
        }
        
        // Check if there's a cycle in the graph
        return !isCyclic(numCourses, adj);  // If there's a cycle, return false; otherwise, return true
    }
};
```

This algorithm ensures that if there is a cycle, you cannot finish all the courses, otherwise, you can finish them.
