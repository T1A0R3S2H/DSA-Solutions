### Explanation

The problem is about determining if it’s possible to finish all courses given the prerequisites. This can be represented as a directed graph problem:

- **Courses** are represented as vertices (nodes) in the graph.
- **Prerequisites** are represented as directed edges between nodes. For instance, if course `a` depends on course `b`, there is a directed edge from `b` to `a`.

To solve the problem, we need to detect if there is a cycle in the directed graph. If there is a cycle, it means there is a set of courses that depend on each other circularly, making it impossible to complete all courses. If there is no cycle, all courses can be completed.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Graph Representation**: Build an adjacency list to represent the graph. If `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]`, it means to take course `a`, one must first take course `b`. So, add `a` to the adjacency list of `b`.

2. **In-degree Calculation**: Calculate the in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex. This helps identify nodes with no prerequisites.

3. **Topological Sort using Kahn’s Algorithm**:
   - Initialize a queue with all vertices having an in-degree of 0 (courses with no prerequisites).
   - Process each node by removing it from the queue, decreasing the in-degree of its neighbors, and adding those neighbors to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0.
   - Keep a count of processed nodes. If the count equals the number of courses (`V`), then no cycle is present, and all courses can be finished. If the count is less than `V`, a cycle exists, and not all courses can be completed.

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: O(E), where `E` is the number of edges (prerequisites).
- **In-degree Calculation**: O(E), since each edge contributes to an in-degree.
- **Topological Sorting**: O(V + E), where `V` is the number of vertices (courses). Each vertex is enqueued and dequeued exactly once, and each edge is processed once.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(V + E)**.

### Space Complexity

- **Adjacency List**: O(V + E), to store the graph.
- **In-degree Array**: O(V), to store the in-degrees of all vertices.
- **Queue**: O(V), in the worst case, all nodes could be in the queue.

Overall, the space complexity is **O(V + E)**.

### Dry Run

Let's do a dry run with a small example:

- `numCourses = 4`
- `prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2]]`

1. **Graph Representation (Adjacency List)**:
   ```
   0 -> [1]
   1 -> [2]
   2 -> [3]
   3 -> []
   ```
   Each array index represents a course, and the list at each index represents the courses that depend on it.

2. **In-degree Calculation**:
   ```
   in-degree[0] = 0
   in-degree[1] = 1
   in-degree[2] = 1
   in-degree[3] = 1
   ```

3. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Start with nodes having in-degree 0: `[0]`.

4. **Processing Nodes**:
   - Dequeue `0`, process its neighbor `1`, reducing `in-degree[1]` to 0. Queue becomes `[1]`.
   - Dequeue `1`, process its neighbor `2`, reducing `in-degree[2]` to 0. Queue becomes `[2]`.
   - Dequeue `2`, process its neighbor `3`, reducing `in-degree[3]` to 0. Queue becomes `[3]`.
   - Dequeue `3`, no more neighbors. Queue becomes `[]`.

5. **Count**:
   - The count of processed nodes is 4, which is equal to `numCourses`.
   - Since the count equals the total number of courses, no cycle is detected.

**Result**: `canFinish` returns `true`, indicating all courses can be completed.

### Summary

The approach effectively detects cycles in a directed graph using topological sorting. The use of the in-degree array and queue allows efficient cycle detection and processing of nodes, ensuring that if there’s a cycle, not all courses can be finished, otherwise, they can. The overall complexity is optimal for this problem type.

1. **`return count != V;`** inside the `isCyclic` function:
2. **`return !isCyclic(numCourses, adj);`** inside the `canFinish` function:

### 1. `return count != V;` (inside `isCyclic` function)

This line is at the end of the `isCyclic` function, which checks if there is a cycle in the graph using Kahn’s algorithm for topological sorting. Here's how it works:

- **Topological Sorting**: This sorting method processes nodes in a directed graph such that for every directed edge `u -> v`, node `u` comes before `v` in the order. If we can create such an ordering for all nodes, it means the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), i.e., no cycles are present.

- **Count**: During the topological sort, we count the number of nodes that are processed. The variable `count` keeps track of how many nodes are dequeued and processed.

- **Graph Properties**:
  - If a graph has no cycles, all nodes will eventually have an in-degree of zero and will be processed. Hence, `count` will equal the number of vertices, `V`.
  - If a graph has a cycle, some nodes will never reach an in-degree of zero because there’s a circular dependency. As a result, not all nodes can be processed, and `count` will be less than `V`.

- **Logic**: `return count != V;`
  - `count != V` evaluates to `true` if there is a cycle (because not all nodes were processed).
  - `count != V` evaluates to `false` if there is no cycle (all nodes were processed).

**Therefore, `return count != V;` returns `true` if a cycle is detected and `false` if there is no cycle.**

### 2. `return !isCyclic(numCourses, adj);` (inside `canFinish` function)

This line is in the `canFinish` function, which determines if all courses can be completed based on their prerequisites. Here’s what it does:

- **Purpose of `canFinish`**: To decide whether all courses (`numCourses`) can be taken given the list of prerequisites. This is equivalent to checking if the corresponding graph of courses and prerequisites has a cycle.

- **isCyclic(numCourses, adj)**: This function is called to detect if there’s a cycle in the graph formed by the courses (`numCourses`) and their prerequisites (`adj` is the adjacency list of the graph).

- **Logic of `!isCyclic(numCourses, adj);`**:
  - `isCyclic(numCourses, adj)` returns `true` if there is a cycle (i.e., not all courses can be finished).
  - `!isCyclic(numCourses, adj)` negates this result, returning `true` if there is no cycle (i.e., all courses can be finished), and `false` if there is a cycle.

**Thus, `return !isCyclic(numCourses, adj);` returns `true` if it is possible to finish all courses (no cycle), and `false` if it is not possible (cycle present).**

### Summary

- `return count != V;` checks if the number of processed nodes is less than the total number of nodes (`V`). If it is, a cycle exists (`true`), otherwise, there is no cycle (`false`).

- `return !isCyclic(numCourses, adj);` uses the result from `isCyclic` to decide if all courses can be finished. It returns `true` if there’s no cycle (all courses can be taken) and `false` if there is a cycle (not all courses can be taken). 

These statements effectively check for the presence of cycles in the graph to determine if it’s feasible to finish all courses, adhering to the prerequisite constraints.
