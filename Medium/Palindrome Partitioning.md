**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 16`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

### Approach

To solve this problem, we will use a backtracking approach with recursion. The idea is to explore all possible partitions of the input string by recursively checking if a substring is a palindrome and then backtracking to explore other possibilities.

### Function Explanations

1. `partition(string s)`:
   - This is the main function that takes the input string `s`.
   - It initializes an empty `result` vector to store all valid palindrome partitionings.
   - It initializes an empty `path` vector to store the current partition being explored.
   - It calls the `backtrack` function with the input string `s`, starting index `0`, the empty `path`, and the `result` vector.
   - After the `backtrack` function finishes, it returns the `result` vector containing all valid palindrome partitionings.

2. `backtrack(const string& s, int start, vector<string>& path, vector<vector<string>>& result)`:
   - This is a recursive function that performs the backtracking process.
   - If the `start` index is equal to the length of the string `s`, it means we have reached the end of the string, so we add the current `path` to the `result` vector and return.
   - Otherwise, we iterate through all possible ending indices `i` from `start` to the end of the string.
   - For each ending index `i`, we check if the substring `s[start:i+1]` is a palindrome using the `isPalindrome` helper function.
   - If the substring is a palindrome, we add it to the `path` vector using `path.push_back(s.substr(start, i - start + 1))`.
   - After adding the palindromic substring to `path`, we recursively call `backtrack` with the next starting index `i + 1`, passing the updated `path` and `result` vectors.
   - After the recursive call returns, we remove the last added substring from `path` using `path.pop_back()`. This is done to backtrack and explore other possible partitions.

3. `isPalindrome(const string& s, int start, int end)`:
   - This is a helper function that checks if the substring `s[start:end+1]` is a palindrome.
   - It uses two pointers, `start` and `end`, to compare characters from the start and end of the substring, moving inwards until the pointers meet or cross over.
   - If at any point the characters at `start` and `end` are not equal, it returns `false` because the substring is not a palindrome.
   - If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, it means the substring is a palindrome, so it returns `true`.

### Code
```bash
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> partition(string s) {
        vector<vector<string>> result;
        vector<string> path;
        backtrack(s, 0, path, result);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void backtrack(const string& s, int start, vector<string>& path,
                   vector<vector<string>>& result) {
        if (start == s.length()) {
            result.push_back(path);
            return;
        }

        else {
            for (int i = start; i < s.length(); i++) {
                if (isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {
                    path.push_back(s.substr(start, i - start + 1));
                    backtrack(s, i + 1, path, result);
                    path.pop_back();
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // separate palindrome function
    bool isPalindrome(const string& s, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            if (s[start++] != s[end--])
                return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
};
```

### Example Walkthrough

Let's go through an example to understand the backtracking process better. Suppose we have the input string `s = "aab"`.

1. The `partition` function initializes an empty `result` vector and an empty `path` vector, and then calls `backtrack(s, 0, path, result)`.
2. Inside the `backtrack` function:
   - `start = 0`, which is not equal to `s.length()` (3), so we enter the loop.
   - The loop starts with `i = start = 0`.
     - `isPalindrome(s, 0, 0)` checks if the substring `s[0:1]` (which is `"a"`) is a palindrome. It is, so we execute the following steps:
       - `path.push_back("a")`: `path` becomes `["a"]`.
       - `backtrack(s, 1, path, result)` is called recursively.
         - Inside the recursive call, `start = 1`, so we enter the loop again.
         - The loop starts with `i = 1`.
           - `isPalindrome(s, 1, 1)` checks if the substring `s[1:2]` (which is `"a"`) is a palindrome. It is, so we execute the following steps:
             - `path.push_back("a")`: `path` becomes `["a", "a"]`.
             - `backtrack(s, 2, path, result)` is called recursively.
               - Inside the recursive call, `start = 2`, which is equal to `s.length()` (3), so we add the current `path` `["a", "a"]` to the `result` vector.
               - The recursive call returns, and we execute `path.pop_back()`: `path` becomes `["a"]` again.
           - The loop continues with `i = 2`.
             - `isPalindrome(s, 1, 2)` checks if the substring `s[1:3]` (which is `"ab"`) is not a palindrome, so we skip this iteration.
         - The recursive call returns, and we execute `path.pop_back()`: `path` becomes empty.
     - The loop continues with `i = 1`.
       - `isPalindrome(s, 0, 1)` checks if the substring `s[0:2]` (which is `"aa"`) is a palindrome. It is, so we execute the following steps:
         - `path.push_back("aa")`: `path` becomes `["aa"]`.
         - `backtrack(s, 2, path, result)` is called recursively.
           - Inside the recursive call, `start = 2`, which is equal to `s.length()` (3), so we add the current `path` `["aa"]` to the `result` vector.
         - The recursive call returns, and we execute `path.pop_back()`: `path` becomes empty again.
     - The loop continues with `i = 2`.
       - `isPalindrome(s, 0, 2)` checks if the substring `s[0:3]` (which is `"aab"`) is not a palindrome, so we skip this iteration.

At this point, the `result` vector contains `[["a", "a"], ["aa"]]`, which are the two valid palindrome partitionings of the string `"aab"`.

The backtracking algorithm explores all possible partitions by recursively checking if a substring is a palindrome and then backtracking to explore other possibilities. The `path` vector keeps track of the current partition being explored, and the `result` vector stores all valid partitions.

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is O(N * 2^N), where N is the length of the input string. This is because, in the worst case, we need to check all possible partitions, and for each partition, we need to check if each substring is a palindrome, which takes O(N) time.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(N * 2^N), which is used to store all the valid partitions and the recursion stack.
