# Explanation of the Happy Number C++ Code

## Overview
The given C++ code checks if a number is a "happy number." A happy number is defined as a number which eventually reaches 1 when replaced by the sum of the squares of its digits repeatedly. If a loop is detected, the number is not happy.

## Key Components

### 1. `sumOfSquaresOfDigits` Function
This is a recursive helper function that calculates the sum of the squares of the digits of a given number `n`.

- **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, return 0.
- **Recursive Case**: Calculate the square of the last digit (`n % 10`) and add it to the result of the function called with `n` divided by 10 (`n / 10`).

### 2. `isHappyHelper` Function
This is another recursive helper function that determines if the number can be reduced to 1.

- **Parameters**: Takes an integer `n` and an unordered set `seen` to keep track of numbers that have already been processed.
- **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, return true (indicating the number is happy).
- **Loop Detection**: If `n` is found in the `seen` set, return false (indicating a loop is detected).
- **Recursive Step**: Add `n` to the `seen` set, calculate the sum of squares of its digits, and recursively call `isHappyHelper` with the new number.

### 3. `isHappy` Function
This is the main function that initiates the process to check if a number is happy.

- **Parameter**: Takes an integer `n`.
- **Local Data Structure**: Initializes an unordered set `seen` to track seen numbers.
- **Return Value**: Calls `isHappyHelper` with `n` and the `seen` set and returns its result.

### 4. `main` Function
The entry point of the program.

- **Reads Input**: Prompts the user to enter a number.
- **Creates `Solution` Instance**: Instantiates an object of the `Solution` class.
- **Checks if Happy**: Calls the `isHappy` method and prints whether the number is happy or not.

## Code
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_set>

using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    // Helper function to calculate the sum of squares of digits
    int sumOfSquaresOfDigits(int n) {
        if (n == 0)
            return 0;
        int digit = n % 10;
        return (digit * digit) + sumOfSquaresOfDigits(n / 10);
    }

    // Helper function to determine if the number is happy
    bool isHappyHelper(int n, unordered_set<int>& seen) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return true; // happy if the number is 1
        }
        if (seen.find(n) != seen.end()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // insert the number
        seen.insert(n);
        int nextNumber = sumOfSquaresOfDigits(n);
        return isHappyHelper(nextNumber, seen);
    }

    // Main function to check if a number is happy
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        unordered_set<int> seen;
        return isHappyHelper(n, seen);
    }
};
```

## Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through the code using the input number `81`:

1. **Main Function**:
    - The user enters `81`.
    - An instance of the `Solution` class is created.
    - The `isHappy` method is called with `81`.

2. **isHappy Function**:
    - An unordered set `seen` is initialized.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `81` and the `seen` set.

3. **isHappyHelper Function** (First Call with `81`):
    - `81` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `81` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `81` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(81)` → `8^2 + 1^2` → `64 + 1` → `65`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `65`.

4. **isHappyHelper Function** (Second Call with `65`):
    - `65` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `65` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `65` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(65)` → `6^2 + 5^2` → `36 + 25` → `61`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `61`.

5. **isHappyHelper Function** (Third Call with `61`):
    - `61` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `61` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `61` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(61)` → `6^2 + 1^2` → `36 + 1` → `37`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `37`.

6. **isHappyHelper Function** (Fourth Call with `37`):
    - `37` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `37` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `37` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(37)` → `3^2 + 7^2` → `9 + 49` → `58`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `58`.

7. **isHappyHelper Function** (Fifth Call with `58`):
    - `58` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `58` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `58` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(58)` → `5^2 + 8^2` → `25 + 64` → `89`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `89`.

8. **isHappyHelper Function** (Sixth Call with `89`):
    - `89` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `89` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `89` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(89)` → `8^2 + 9^2` → `64 + 81` → `145`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `145`.

9. **isHappyHelper Function** (Seventh Call with `145`):
    - `145` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `145` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `145` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(145)` → `1^2 + 4^2 + 5^2` → `1 + 16 + 25` → `42`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `42`.

10. **isHappyHelper Function** (Eighth Call with `42`):
    - `42` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `42` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `42` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(42)` → `4^2 + 2^2` → `16 + 4` → `20`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `20`.

11. **isHappyHelper Function** (Ninth Call with `20`):
    - `20` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `20` is added to `seen`.

        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(20)` → `2^2 + 0^2` → `4 + 0` → `4`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `4`.

12. **isHappyHelper Function** (Tenth Call with `4`):
    - `4` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `4` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `4` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(4)` → `4^2` → `16`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `16`.

13. **isHappyHelper Function** (Eleventh Call with `16`):
    - `16` is not `1` and not in `seen`, so `16` is added to `seen`.
    - The sum of squares of digits of `16` is calculated:
        - `sumOfSquaresOfDigits(16)` → `1^2 + 6^2` → `1 + 36` → `37`.
    - `isHappyHelper` is called with `37`.

14. **isHappyHelper Function** (Twelfth Call with `37`):
    - `37` is already in `seen`, indicating a loop.
    - The function returns `false`.

15. **Main Function**:
    - The result `false` is received.
    - The program prints "The number is not happy."

## Conclusion
For the input number `81`, the function detects a loop, indicating that the number is not happy. The code efficiently checks for happy numbers using recursion and an unordered set to detect loops.
