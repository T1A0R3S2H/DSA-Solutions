### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isMirror(TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right) {
        if (!left && !right) return true;
        if (!left || !right) return false;
        return (left->val==right->val) &&
               isMirror(left->left, right->right) &&
               isMirror(left->right, right->left);
    }

    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true;
        return isMirror(root->left, root->right);
    }
};

```
### Explanation

The code aims to determine if a binary tree is symmetric around its center. A tree is symmetric if the left subtree is a mirror reflection of the right subtree. This check is done using a recursive helper function called `isMirror`, which compares two nodes to see if they are mirrors of each other.

1. **`isMirror(TreeNode* left, TreeNode* right)`**: This helper function checks if two trees (or subtrees) are mirror images of each other.
   - If both `left` and `right` are `nullptr`, the function returns `true` since two empty trees are mirrors.
   - If one is `nullptr` and the other isn't, it returns `false` because they can't be mirrors.
   - If both nodes have values, it checks:
     - Their values must be equal.
     - The left subtree of `left` must be a mirror of the right subtree of `right`.
     - The right subtree of `left` must be a mirror of the left subtree of `right`.

2. **`isSymmetric(TreeNode* root)`**: This function checks if the whole tree is symmetric. It uses the `isMirror` function to compare the left and right subtrees of the root.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- The time complexity is **O(N)**, where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once to compare it with its mirror counterpart.

### Space Complexity Analysis

- The space complexity is **O(H)**, where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, for a completely unbalanced tree, H can be N (the total number of nodes), making the space complexity O(N). For a balanced tree, H would be log(N), making the space complexity O(log N).

### Dry Run

Let's consider a simple symmetric tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   2
     / \ / \
    3  4 4  3
```

1. **Initial Call: `isSymmetric(root)`**
   - `root` is not `nullptr`, so it calls `isMirror(root->left, root->right)` with `left = 2` and `right = 2`.

2. **First Call to `isMirror(2, 2)`**
   - Both `left` and `right` are not `nullptr`, and `left->val == right->val` (both are 2).
   - It recursively calls `isMirror(left->left, right->right)` with `left = 3` and `right = 3`.

3. **Second Call to `isMirror(3, 3)`**
   - Both `left` and `right` are not `nullptr`, and `left->val == right->val` (both are 3).
   - It recursively calls `isMirror(left->left, right->right)` with `left = nullptr` and `right = nullptr`.
   
4. **Third Call to `isMirror(nullptr, nullptr)`**
   - Both `left` and `right` are `nullptr`, so it returns `true`.
   - It then calls `isMirror(left->right, right->left)` with `left = nullptr` and `right = nullptr`.

5. **Fourth Call to `isMirror(nullptr, nullptr)`**
   - Both `left` and `right` are `nullptr`, so it returns `true`.
   - The second call to `isMirror(3, 3)` returns `true`.

6. **Back to First Call to `isMirror(2, 2)`**
   - It now calls `isMirror(left->right, right->left)` with `left = 4` and `right = 4`.

7. **Fifth Call to `isMirror(4, 4)`**
   - Both `left` and `right` are not `nullptr`, and `left->val == right->val` (both are 4).
   - It recursively calls `isMirror(left->left, right->right)` with `left = nullptr` and `right = nullptr`.

8. **Sixth Call to `isMirror(nullptr, nullptr)`**
   - Both `left` and `right` are `nullptr`, so it returns `true`.
   - It then calls `isMirror(left->right, right->left)` with `left = nullptr` and `right = nullptr`.

9. **Seventh Call to `isMirror(nullptr, nullptr)`**
   - Both `left` and `right` are `nullptr`, so it returns `true`.
   - The fifth call to `isMirror(4, 4)` returns `true`.
   - The first call to `isMirror(2, 2)` returns `true`.

10. **Final Return**
    - The initial call to `isSymmetric(root)` returns `true`, indicating that the tree is symmetric.

### Conclusion

The algorithm effectively checks whether a binary tree is symmetric by comparing the left and right subtrees recursively. The key insight is that for a tree to be symmetric, the left subtree must be a mirror of the right subtree.
