## Method 1
```bash
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        int currentCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                currentCount++;
                maxCount = max(maxCount, currentCount);
            } else {
                currentCount = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }
};
```

## Method 2 (XOR)
The XOR approach to finding the maximum consecutive ones in a binary array involves iterating through the array and using the XOR operation to check if the current element and the next element are the same (both 1 or both 0). If they are the same, it increments a counter `count`. However, if they are different or if the current element is 0, it resets the `count` to 0 and updates a `maxCount` variable with the maximum value between `maxCount` and the previous `count + 1`. Additionally, it needs to handle the case where the last element (or the last few elements) of the array are ones separately, as the XOR operation with the next element would be out of bounds. This approach requires carefully handling edge cases and updating the `maxCount` variable correctly to keep track of the maximum consecutive ones seen so far. While the XOR approach can work, it introduces unnecessary complexity and potential edge cases compared to a simpler loop approach that directly checks if the current element is 1, increments the count, and updates the maximum count seen so far accordingly.
```bash
class Solution {
public:
    int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int count = 0, maxCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                if (nums[i] ^ nums[i + 1] == 0) {
                    count++;
                } else {
                    maxCount = max(maxCount, count + 1);
                    count = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Handle the case where the last element is 1
        if (nums[n - 1] == 1) {
            maxCount = max(maxCount, count + 1);
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }
};
```
