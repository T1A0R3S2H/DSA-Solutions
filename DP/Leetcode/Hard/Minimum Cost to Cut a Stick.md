### Problem Breakdown

You're given a stick of length `n` and an array `cuts[]` where each element `cuts[i]` indicates a position where you can make a cut. The cost of making a cut is the length of the stick being cut at that time. The goal is to minimize the total cost of all cuts.

### Approach

1. **Recursive Subproblem**:
   - For each range `[l, r]` where `l` and `r` are indices in the `cuts[]` array, we want to find the minimum cost to make all cuts between these two points. If there are no cuts between `l` and `r`, the cost is 0.
   - For each cut `i` between `l` and `r`, you will:
     - Cut the stick at position `cuts[i]`.
     - The cost of making that cut is `cuts[r] - cuts[l]`.
     - After making this cut, you split the problem into two subproblems: one from `l` to `i`, and the other from `i` to `r`.
     - You then recursively calculate the total cost for both subproblems and add the cost of making the cut at `i`.

2. **Memoization**:
   - This problem has overlapping subproblems because the same subproblem can be computed multiple times (e.g., the minimum cost for a range `[l, r]` can be recalculated in different recursive branches). 
   - Memoization is used to store the results of subproblems in a table (a 2D DP table `dp[][]`) to avoid redundant calculations.
   
3. **Sorting the cuts**:
   - The cuts array is sorted before processing. This helps to ensure that you always cut the stick in increasing order of positions, which is necessary for solving the subproblems efficiently.
   - We also add the endpoints `0` and `n` to the `cuts[]` array because the cuts can be made only between these points.

### Code with Explanation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solveMem(int l, int r, vector<int>& cuts, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        if (l+1==r) return 0;
        if (dp[l][r]!=-1) return dp[l][r];
        int mini=INT_MAX;
        for (int i=l+1; i<r; i++) {
            int cost=(cuts[r]-cuts[l])+solveMem(l, i, cuts, dp)+solveMem(i, r, cuts, dp);
            mini=min(mini, cost);
        }
        dp[l][r]=mini;
        return mini;
    }

    int minCost(int n, vector<int>& cuts) {
        cuts.push_back(0);
        cuts.push_back(n);

        //important, sorting is done not for the problem but for the dp
        //so that the dp may solve smaller subproblems first
        //yaaar tough yaar but good learning!!
        sort(cuts.begin(), cuts.end());
        int m=cuts.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m+2, vector<int>(m+2, -1));
        return solveMem(0, m-1, cuts, dp);
    }
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Function `solveMem(l, r, cuts, dp)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of making cuts between the positions `l` and `r` in the `cuts[]` array.
   - If `l+1 == r`, it means there are no cuts between `l` and `r`, so the cost is `0`.
   - If the result for this subproblem has already been computed (`dp[l][r] != -1`), it returns the stored result.
   - Otherwise, it iterates over all possible cuts `i` between `l` and `r`, calculating the cost for making the cut at `i`, and recursively solves the subproblems between `[l, i]` and `[i, r]`. The result is stored in `dp[l][r]`.

2. **Function `minCost(n, cuts)`**:
   - Adds the starting point `0` and the ending point `n` to the `cuts[]` array.
   - Sorts the `cuts[]` array to ensure cuts are processed in increasing order.
   - Initializes the DP table with `-1` and calls the `solveMem` function to compute the minimum cost.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the `cuts[]` array takes \(O(m \log m)\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts.
  
- **Dynamic Programming**:
  - We use a 2D DP table where the dimensions are \(m \times m\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts (including `0` and `n`). 
  - The recursion explores every subproblem defined by the pair `(l, r)` where `l` and `r` are indices in the `cuts[]` array.
  - For each subproblem, we check each possible cut `i` between `l` and `r`, which takes \(O(m)\) work.
  - Therefore, the time complexity of solving the problem is \(O(m^3)\).

**Overall Time Complexity**:  
\[
O(m^3 + m \log m) = O(m^3)
\]
Where \(m\) is the number of cuts (which is at most 100).

### Space Complexity

- **DP Table**: The DP table `dp[][]` is a 2D table of size \(m \times m\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts (including `0` and `n`), so the space complexity for the DP table is \(O(m^2)\).
  
- **Auxiliary Space**: The space used by the `cuts[]` array is \(O(m)\), and the recursion stack in the worst case will have a depth of \(O(m)\), resulting in additional \(O(m)\) space.

**Overall Space Complexity**:  
\[
O(m^2)
\]

### Summary

- **Explanation**: The algorithm uses dynamic programming with memoization to compute the minimum cost of cutting the stick. It breaks the problem into smaller subproblems where it evaluates all possible cuts between the current range, and then combines the results to find the optimal cost.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m^3)\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts (including 0 and `n`).
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m^2)\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts (including 0 and `n`).

### Dry Run 
Let's dry run the given code with the input `n = 7` and `cuts = [1, 3, 4, 5]`. 

### Initial Setup:
- Stick length `n = 7`
- Cuts = `[1, 3, 4, 5]`
- We add `0` (left endpoint) and `7` (right endpoint) to the `cuts[]` array, resulting in `cuts = [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7]`.

### Step 1: Sorting the Cuts Array
- The `cuts[]` array is sorted, but in this case, it is already sorted as `[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7]`.

### Step 2: Calling `solveMem(0, 5, cuts, dp)`
- We need to calculate the minimum cost for the range `[0, 7]`. This is done by considering all possible cuts between these two points.
  
  **DP table initialization**:  
  A 2D DP table is created, initialized to `-1`, where each entry `dp[l][r]` represents the minimum cost of making cuts between `cuts[l]` and `cuts[r]`.
  
  **The DP table looks like this at the start**:
  ```
  dp = [
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
    [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]
  ]
  ```

### Step 3: Recursive Calculations for Subproblems

1. **First call: `solveMem(0, 5, cuts, dp)`**:
   - We are calculating the minimum cost to cut the stick from `0` to `7`.
   - The cuts array is `[0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7]`, and we need to consider all possible cuts between `cuts[0]` and `cuts[5]`.

   We evaluate each possible cut:
   
   - **Cut at `cuts[1] = 1`**:
     - Cost of cutting here is `cuts[5] - cuts[0] = 7 - 0 = 7`.
     - We split the problem into two subproblems: `[0, 1]` and `[1, 7]`.
     - The cost is `7 + solveMem(0, 1, cuts, dp) + solveMem(1, 5, cuts, dp)`.

     We continue solving the subproblems for `[0, 1]` and `[1, 7]`.

2. **Subproblem 1: `solveMem(0, 1, cuts, dp)`**:
   - Since `l + 1 == r`, there are no cuts between `0` and `1`. The cost is `0`.

3. **Subproblem 2: `solveMem(1, 5, cuts, dp)`**:
   - We now calculate the minimum cost to cut the stick between `1` and `7`. The possible cuts are `[3, 4, 5]`.
   - We iterate through each cut between `1` and `7`.

   - **Cut at `cuts[2] = 3`**:
     - Cost of cutting here is `cuts[5] - cuts[1] = 7 - 1 = 6`.
     - We split the problem into two subproblems: `[1, 3]` and `[3, 7]`.
     - The cost is `6 + solveMem(1, 3, cuts, dp) + solveMem(3, 5, cuts, dp)`.

     We continue solving the subproblems for `[1, 3]` and `[3, 5]`.

4. **Subproblem 3: `solveMem(1, 3, cuts, dp)`**:
   - We now calculate the minimum cost to cut the stick between `1` and `3`. The only cut possible is `cuts[2] = 3`.
   - The cost of making this cut is `3 - 1 = 2`. Since there are no further cuts, the total cost is `2`.

5. **Subproblem 4: `solveMem(3, 5, cuts, dp)`**:
   - We now calculate the minimum cost to cut the stick between `3` and `5`. The only cut possible is `cuts[3] = 4`.
   - The cost of making this cut is `5 - 3 = 2`. Since there are no further cuts, the total cost is `2`.

6. **Now, we combine the results from subproblems**:
   - **For `solveMem(1, 5, cuts, dp)`**, the cost is `6 + 2 + 2 = 10`.
   
   Returning to **`solveMem(0, 5, cuts, dp)`**, we now calculate the total cost for making the first cut at `cuts[1] = 1`:
   - The cost is `7 + 0 + 10 = 17`.

### Step 4: Continuing with Other Cut Positions
- **Cut at `cuts[2] = 3`**:
   - We calculate the total cost for this cut and similar recursive calculations will follow for all the other cuts, but after comparing, we find that the minimum cost occurs when the cuts are made in the order `[3, 5, 1, 4]`, which results in a total cost of `16`.

### Final Answer
- The minimum cost to make all the cuts is `16`.

---

### Summary of Dry Run

- The algorithm explores all possible ways to make cuts by dividing the problem into subproblems and recursively calculating the minimum cost for each subproblem.
- Memoization is used to store already computed results for subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
- The minimum cost is achieved by evaluating all possible orders of cuts, and the optimal order minimizes the total cost.
