### TL;DR Explanation:

The solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to determine the maximum possible height for the billboard, where two subsets of rods are required to have the same sum. The key idea is to recursively try placing each rod into one of the two subsets or skipping it, while keeping track of the difference (`diff`) between the heights of the two subsets. The `solveMem` function is called recursively for each rod, with three main choices: skip the rod, add it to the first subset (increasing the difference), or add it to the second subset (decreasing the difference and adding the rod's length to that subset). Memoization is applied to store the results of previously computed states, where `dp[index][diff + offset]` stores the maximum achievable height for a given `index` and `diff` value, offset to ensure non-negative indices.

The sizes of the dynamic programming (DP) table are chosen based on the number of rods and the total sum of the rods. The `dp` table has dimensions `[n+1][2*sum+1]`, where `n` is the number of rods and `sum` is the total length of all rods. The `n+1` accounts for the number of rods plus one (for the base case), while the `2*sum+1` accounts for the possible range of differences between the two subsets, from `-sum` to `+sum`. The offset is used to map negative differences into positive indices (shifting the range to `[0, 2*sum]`), ensuring that all states are valid within the bounds of the DP table. This design allows efficient computation of the maximum possible height, avoiding redundant calculations by reusing previously computed states.

### **Code:**
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solveMem(int index, int diff, vector<int>& rods, vector<vector<int>>& dp, int offset) {
        if (dp[index][diff+offset]!=-1) {
            return dp[index][diff+offset];
        }

        // Base case: all rods are processed
        if (index==rods.size()) {
            if (diff==0) return 0; // Valid equal-height subsets
            else return INT_MIN; // Invalid configuration
        }

        // Current rod
        int rod=rods[index];

        // Option 1: Skip the current rod
        int skip=solveMem(index+1, diff, rods, dp, offset);
        // Option 2: Add the rod to the first subset (increase the diff)
        int addToFirst=solveMem(index+1, diff+rod, rods, dp, offset);
        // Option 3: Add the rod to the second subset (decrease diff)
        int addToSecond=solveMem(index+1, diff-rod, rods, dp, offset)+rod;  //add the curr rod also

        dp[index][diff+offset]=max(max(skip, addToFirst), addToSecond);
        return dp[index][diff+offset];
    }

    int tallestBillboard(vector<int>& rods) {
        int sum=0;
        for (int rod:rods) sum+=rod;
        int offset=sum; // Offset to handle negative differences
        vector<vector<int>> dp(rods.size()+1, vector<int>(2*sum+1, -1));
        // index=0, diff=0
        int result=solveMem(0, 0, rods, dp, offset);
        if (result<0) result=0;
        return result;
    }
};

```


### **Explanation:**

The problem involves dividing rods into two subsets of equal height (same sum). You are asked to find the largest possible height of the billboard (maximum sum of either subset). We aim to achieve this by using dynamic programming and memoization.

#### Key Idea:
- We use **recursion** and **memoization** to keep track of the maximum height of one subset while maintaining a difference (`diff`) between the heights of the two subsets.
- The `solveMem` function is called recursively to try all possibilities:
  1. Skip the current rod.
  2. Add the rod to the first subset (increase the difference).
  3. Add the rod to the second subset (decrease the difference and add it to the current height of that subset).
  
The memoization table `dp[index][diff + offset]` stores the results for previously computed states, where:
- `index` represents the current rod.
- `diff` represents the height difference between the two subsets (with an offset to handle negative values).
  
The goal is to compute the maximum height achievable where the difference between the two subsets is zero (`diff == 0`).

### **Time Complexity:**

- **Recursion depth:** The recursion will process every rod once, so it will recurse `n` times, where `n` is the number of rods.
- **State space:** For each rod, the difference `diff` can range from `-sum` to `+sum` (where `sum` is the total sum of all rods). This gives a possible state space of `2 * sum + 1` for the difference.
  
Thus, the time complexity is:
\[
O(n \cdot \text{sum})
\]
Where:
- `n` is the number of rods.
- `sum` is the total sum of all rods.

### **Space Complexity:**

- We are using a 2D memoization table `dp[index][diff + offset]` where `index` can go from 0 to `n` (number of rods) and `diff` can range from `-sum` to `+sum`, which results in a table size of `n+1` by `2*sum + 1`.
  
Thus, the space complexity is:
\[
O(n \cdot \text{sum})
\]
Where:
- `n` is the number of rods.
- `sum` is the total sum of all rods.

### **Dry Run:**

Let's go through a dry run of the code using the example input:

**Example 1:**
- `rods = [1, 2, 3, 6]`

**Step 1: Initialization**
- `sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12`
- `offset = 12`
- `dp` table of size `[5][25]` (since `n = 4` and `sum = 12`).
  
**Step 2: First call to `solveMem(0, 0, rods, dp, offset)`**
- We start with `index = 0` and `diff = 0`.

**Step 3: Recursive Calls**
1. **First rod (1):**
   - We have three choices:
     1. **Skip**: Move to `solveMem(1, 0, rods, dp, offset)` (no change in diff).
     2. **Add to first subset**: Move to `solveMem(1, 1, rods, dp, offset)` (increase diff by 1).
     3. **Add to second subset**: Move to `solveMem(1, -1, rods, dp, offset)` (decrease diff by 1 and add rod to the second subset).
   
2. **Second rod (2):**
   - For each of the recursive calls above, we try all three options again (skip, add to first subset, add to second subset).
   
3. **Third rod (3):**
   - We continue recursively calling `solveMem` for each possible combination of adding rods to either subset.

4. **Fourth rod (6):**
   - We continue recursively calling `solveMem` until we process all rods.

**Step 4: Base Case**
- When all rods have been processed (`index == rods.size()`), we check if `diff == 0`:
  - If `diff == 0`, it means the two subsets have equal heights, so we return `0` (since there is no more height to add).
  - If `diff != 0`, it means the subsets cannot be balanced, so we return `INT_MIN` (invalid state).

**Step 5: Backtracking and Memoization**
- During the backtracking process, the results of all recursive calls are stored in the `dp` table to avoid redundant computations.
  
**Step 6: Final Result**
- After processing all rods, we check the result of `solveMem(0, 0, rods, dp, offset)`:
  - If the result is less than 0 (indicating no valid solution), return 0 (since no balanced subset configuration exists).
  - Otherwise, return the maximum height of the billboard.

### Dry Run Example for `rods = [1, 2, 3, 6]`:

#### Step-by-Step Walkthrough:

- **Initialization:**
  - `sum = 12`, `offset = 12`, `dp = 5 x 25 matrix initialized to -1`.

- **First rod (1):**
  - Call `solveMem(1, 0)` â†’ check three options: skip, add to first subset, add to second subset.
  - Proceed recursively to process further rods.

- **Continue recursively for all rods:**
  - Each rod is added to one of the two subsets or skipped.
  
- **Base Case (when `index == rods.size()`):**
  - When all rods are processed, check if `diff == 0`. If so, return 0 (valid configuration), otherwise return `INT_MIN`.

- **Final Result:**
  - After recursion finishes, the final result is `6`, which is the maximum possible height for the billboard.

---

### Conclusion:
This solution efficiently computes the largest possible height for the billboard by recursively trying all possible ways of dividing the rods into two subsets, while using memoization to avoid redundant computations. The approach runs in \(O(n \cdot \text{sum})\) time and uses the same amount of space for memoization.
