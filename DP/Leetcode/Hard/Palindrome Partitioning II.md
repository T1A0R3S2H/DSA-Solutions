### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int dp[2002][2002];
    bool isPalindrome(string &s, int start, int end) {
        while (start<end) {
            if (s[start]!=s[end]) return false;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    int solveMem(string &s, int start, int end) {
        if (start>=end || isPalindrome(s, start, end)) return 0;
        if (dp[start][end]!=-1) return dp[start][end];
        int mini=INT_MAX;
        for (int i=start; i<=end-1; i++) {
            if (isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {
                int tempCuts=1+solveMem(s, i+1, end);
                mini=min(mini, tempCuts);
            }
        }
        return dp[start][end]=mini;
    }

    int minCut(string s) {
        int n=s.length();
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {
                dp[i][j]=-1;
            }
        }
        return solveMem(s, 0, n-1);
    }
};

```

### Explanation:
1. **isPalindrome Function:**
   - This helper function checks whether the substring `s[start:end]` is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends. It returns `true` if it's a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
   
2. **solveMem Function (Memoization):**
   - This function recursively finds the minimum cuts needed to split the string `s[start:end]` into palindromic substrings. 
   - If the substring is already a palindrome or the `start` index is greater than or equal to the `end` index, no cuts are required (returns 0).
   - If the result for the substring is already computed (i.e., `dp[start][end]` is not `-1`), it returns the previously computed value.
   - For each position `i` in the substring, it checks if the substring `s[start:i]` is a palindrome. If it is, the function recursively calculates the minimum cuts for the remaining part `s[i+1:end]`. The minimum cuts across all valid partitions are stored in `dp[start][end]`.

3. **minCut Function:**
   - This is the main function that initializes the dynamic programming table `dp` to `-1` and calls `solveMem` to compute the minimum cuts required for the entire string.
   - The `dp` table is initialized with `-1` to represent uncomputed states. The result is stored in `dp[0][n-1]` where `n` is the length of the string.

### Time Complexity:
- **Palindrome Check:** For each pair of indices `(start, end)`, checking if the substring is a palindrome takes O(n) time.
- **Memoization:** We have a `dp` table of size O(n^2), and for each pair `(start, end)`, we may need to perform a loop up to `n` times to check for possible cuts. This gives a worst-case time complexity of **O(n^3)**.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n^3) due to the nested recursive calls and the palindrome checks.

### Space Complexity:
- The `dp` array requires **O(n^2)** space to store the results of subproblems.
- The recursive stack also contributes to the space complexity. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion is O(n), leading to an overall space complexity of **O(n^2)**.

### Dry Run (Input: "aab"):

1. **Initialization:**
   - `dp` table is initialized with `-1`.

2. **First call to solveMem(s, 0, 2):**
   - The substring is `"aab"`, which is not a palindrome.
   - We try splitting the string at different positions.

3. **Loop through possible cuts:**
   - At `i = 0`, we check if `"a"` (s[0:0]) is a palindrome (it is). We now recursively solve for `solveMem(s, 1, 2)` for the remaining substring `"ab"`.

4. **Second call to solveMem(s, 1, 2):**
   - The substring `"ab"` is not a palindrome.
   - We check splitting it at `i = 1`. We check if `"a"` (s[1:1]) is a palindrome (it is). Now we recursively solve for `solveMem(s, 2, 2)`.

5. **Third call to solveMem(s, 2, 2):**
   - The substring `"b"` is a single character, so it's trivially a palindrome. This returns 0 (no cuts needed).

6. **Backtracking:**
   - From `solveMem(s, 1, 2)`, the result is `1` (one cut needed for the substring `"ab"`). This is stored in `dp[1][2]`.
   - From `solveMem(s, 0, 2)`, the result is `1` (one cut needed for the substring `"aab"`). This is stored in `dp[0][2]`.

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The function `minCut(s)` returns `1`, which is the minimum number of cuts needed for the input string `"aab"`.

### Final Answer:
The minimum number of cuts required to partition the string `"aab"` into palindromes is **1**.
