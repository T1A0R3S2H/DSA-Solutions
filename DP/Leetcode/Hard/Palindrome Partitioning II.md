### Code:

class Solution {
public:
    int dp[2002][2002];
    bool isPalindrome(string &s, int start, int end) {
        while (start<end) {
            if (s[start]!=s[end]) return false;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    int solveMem(string &s, int start, int end) {
        if (start>=end || isPalindrome(s, start, end)) return 0;

        int mini=INT_MAX;
        for (int i=start; i<=end-1; i++) {
            if (isPalindrome(s, start, i)) {
                int tempCuts=1+solveMem(s, i+1, end);
                mini=min(mini, tempCuts);
            }
        }
        return dp[start][end]=mini;
    }

    int minCut(string s) {
        int n=s.length();
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            for (int j=0; j<n; j++) {
                dp[i][j]=-1;
            }
        }
        return solveMem(s, 0, n-1);

### Explanation:
1. **isPalindrome Function:**
   - This helper function checks whether the substring `s[start:end]` is a palindrome by comparing characters from both ends. It returns `true` if it's a palindrome and `false` otherwise.
   
2. **solveMem Function (Memoization):**
   - This function recursively finds the minimum cuts needed to split the string `s[start:end]` into palindromic substrings. 
   - If the substring is already a palindrome or the `start` index is greater than or equal to the `end` index, no cuts are required (returns 0).
   - If the result for the substring is already computed (i.e., `dp[start][end]` is not `-1`), it returns the previously computed value.
   - For each position `i` in the substring, it checks if the substring `s[start:i]` is a palindrome. If it is, the function recursively calculates the minimum cuts for the remaining part `s[i+1:end]`. The minimum cuts across all valid partitions are stored in `dp[start][end]`.

3. **minCut Function:**
   - This is the main function that initializes the dynamic programming table `dp` to `-1` and calls `solveMem` to compute the minimum cuts required for the entire string.
   - The `dp` table is initialized with `-1` to represent uncomputed states. The result is stored in `dp[0][n-1]` where `n` is the length of the string.

### Time Complexity:
- **Palindrome Check:** For each pair of indices `(start, end)`, checking if the substring is a palindrome takes O(n) time.
- **Memoization:** We have a `dp` table of size O(n^2), and for each pair `(start, end)`, we may need to perform a loop up to `n` times to check for possible cuts. This gives a worst-case time complexity of **O(n^3)**.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n^3) due to the nested recursive calls and the palindrome checks.

### Space Complexity:
- The `dp` array requires **O(n^2)** space to store the results of subproblems.
- The recursive stack also contributes to the space complexity. In the worst case, the depth of the recursion is O(n), leading to an overall space complexity of **O(n^2)**.

### Dry Run (Input: "aab"):


We will perform a full dry run for the input `"aab"` and trace the recursive calls, state changes, and computations step by step.

### Initialization:
- `dp[2002][2002]` array is initialized to `-1` for all pairs.
- We are solving for the string `"aab"` where `start = 0` and `end = 2` (the length of the string minus one).

### Function Call Stack:
1. **Initial Call: `solveMem(s, 0, 2)`**
   - We are trying to find the minimum cuts needed for the substring `"aab"`.
   - Since `"aab"` is not a palindrome (checked by `isPalindrome(s, 0, 2)`), we proceed to check possible cuts.
   - We iterate through `i` from `0` to `1` (since `end = 2`).

#### Loop: Checking Possible Cuts
- **For `i = 0`:**
    - We check if the substring `"a"` (i.e., `s[0:0]`) is a palindrome, which it is.
    - Now, we make a recursive call to `solveMem(s, 1, 2)` to solve for the substring `"ab"`.

2. **Recursive Call: `solveMem(s, 1, 2)`**
   - We are solving for the substring `"ab"`.
   - Since `"ab"` is not a palindrome (checked by `isPalindrome(s, 1, 2)`), we again check possible cuts.
   - We iterate through `i` from `1` to `1`.

#### Loop: Checking Possible Cuts for `"ab"`
- **For `i = 1`:**
    - We check if the substring `"a"` (i.e., `s[1:1]`) is a palindrome, which it is.
    - Now, we make a recursive call to `solveMem(s, 2, 2)` to solve for the substring `"b"`.

3. **Recursive Call: `solveMem(s, 2, 2)`**
   - We are solving for the substring `"b"`.
   - Since `"b"` is a single character, it is trivially a palindrome. Hence, we return `0` (no cuts needed for a single character).
   - This result is returned to the previous function call, `solveMem(s, 1, 2)`.

#### Backtracking to `solveMem(s, 1, 2)`
- From `solveMem(s, 2, 2)`, we get `0`. Therefore, the result for `solveMem(s, 1, 2)` is `1` (one cut for the substring `"ab"`).
- We store this value in `dp[1][2]` to avoid recomputation.
- We return `1` from `solveMem(s, 1, 2)`.

#### Backtracking to `solveMem(s, 0, 2)`
- From `solveMem(s, 1, 2)`, we get `1`. Therefore, the result for `solveMem(s, 0, 2)` is `1` (one cut for the substring `"aab"`).
- We store this value in `dp[0][2]` to avoid recomputation.
- We return `1` from `solveMem(s, 0, 2)`.

### Final Result:
- The function `minCut(s)` returns the value `1`, which is the minimum number of cuts required to partition the string `"aab"` into palindromes.

### Summary of Recursion:

- **First call (`solveMem(s, 0, 2)`)**: We check if `"aab"` is a palindrome (it's not). We try making a cut at `i = 0`, checking `"a"` (which is a palindrome), and recurse on the substring `"ab"`.
- **Second call (`solveMem(s, 1, 2)`)**: We check if `"ab"` is a palindrome (it's not). We try making a cut at `i = 1`, checking `"a"` (which is a palindrome), and recurse on the substring `"b"`.
- **Third call (`solveMem(s, 2, 2)`)**: We reach the base case, as `"b"` is a single character, and return `0` (no cuts needed).
- **Backtrack**: From the results of the recursion, we determine that `"ab"` requires `1` cut, and thus `"aab"` also requires `1` cut.

### Dry Run Output:
For the input `"aab"`, the minimum cuts required to partition the string into palindromic substrings is **1**.
