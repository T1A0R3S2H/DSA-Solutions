The reason you and your friends cannot take adjacent slices is based on the rules of the problem. When you pick a slice, your friends Alice and Bob immediately take the slices next to it—one in the clockwise direction and the other in the anti-clockwise direction. This means that once you pick a slice, the adjacent slices are automatically taken by your friends, leaving you with non-adjacent slices for your next pick.

Here’s a breakdown of why:

- When you select a slice, Alice takes the slice immediately to your left (anti-clockwise), and Bob takes the slice immediately to your right (clockwise).
- This effectively removes three slices from the circle (yours and the two adjacent slices), so you are forced to pick from the remaining slices that are not adjacent to your previous pick.

This setup is a key constraint of the problem, which forces you to maximize your selections from non-adjacent slices while still picking `n` slices in total.

### Intuition of the solution

The problem is a variation of the "House Robber" problem, but applied to a circular array with an additional constraint: you and your friends cannot take adjacent slices, and you must make a total of exactly `n` selections. To solve this, we need to find the maximum sum of slice sizes that you can pick while adhering to these constraints.

The solution revolves around breaking the problem into two cases:
1. Ignore the last slice and select from the range `0 to k-2`.
2. Ignore the first slice and select from the range `1 to k-1`.

We use dynamic programming to make a choice at each slice:
- Either take the current slice and skip the next one.
- Or skip the current slice and consider the next one.

The goal is to maximize the sum of slices selected while ensuring that no adjacent slices are picked.

### Approach 1: Recursion + Memoization

#### Base Case:
- If `n == 0` (no more slices to pick) or if the starting index (`sindex`) exceeds the ending index (`eindex`), return `0`, as no valid selection can be made.

#### Recursive Case:
- If the result for the current subproblem is already computed, return the stored value from the `dp` array.
- Otherwise, compute the result by either:
  - Taking the current slice (`sindex`) and recursively solving for the remaining slices with `sindex + 2`.
  - Skipping the current slice and solving for `sindex + 1`.
- Store and return the maximum of these two options.

**Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    int solveMem(int sindex, int eindex, vector<int>& slices, int n, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        if (n == 0 || sindex > eindex) return 0;
        if (dp[sindex][n] != -1) return dp[sindex][n];
        
        int take = slices[sindex] + solveMem(sindex + 2, eindex, slices, n - 1, dp);
        int notTake = solveMem(sindex + 1, eindex, slices, n, dp);
        
        return dp[sindex][n] = max(take, notTake);
    }
    
public:
    int maxSizeSlices(vector<int>& slices) {
        int k = slices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp1(k, vector<int>(k, -1));
        int case1 = solveMem(0, k - 2, slices, k / 3, dp1);
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp2(k, vector<int>(k, -1));
        int case2 = solveMem(1, k - 1, slices, k / 3, dp2);
        
        return max(case1, case2);
    }
};
```

### Approach 2: Tabulation

#### Concept:
- Tabulation is a bottom-up approach. Instead of solving subproblems recursively, we iteratively fill a 2D array (`dp`) to store the maximum sums for each subproblem.
- We handle two cases:
  1. Consider slices from `0 to k-2`.
  2. Consider slices from `1 to k-1`.

#### Explanation:
- Initialize two 2D arrays (`dp1` and `dp2`), where:
  - `dp1[index][n]` stores the maximum sum possible by taking exactly `n` slices from index `0 to k-2`.
  - `dp2[index][n]` stores the same for index `1 to k-1`.
- Fill the tables by iterating from the last slice to the first, calculating whether to take or skip the current slice.
- The final result is stored in `dp1[0][k/3]` and `dp2[1][k/3]`.
  
**Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    int solveTab(vector<int>& slices) {
        int k = slices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp1(k + 2, vector<int>(k, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> dp2(k + 2, vector<int>(k, 0));

        for (int index = k - 2; index >= 0; index--) {
            for (int n = 1; n <= k / 3; n++) {
                int take = slices[index] + dp1[index + 2][n - 1];
                int notTake = dp1[index + 1][n];
                dp1[index][n] = max(take, notTake);
            }
        }
        int case1 = dp1[0][k / 3];

        for (int index = k - 1; index >= 1; index--) {
            for (int n = 1; n <= k / 3; n++) {
                int take = slices[index] + dp2[index + 2][n - 1];
                int notTake = dp2[index + 1][n];
                dp2[index][n] = max(take, notTake);
            }
        }
        int case2 = dp2[1][k / 3];

        return max(case1, case2);
    }

public:
    int maxSizeSlices(vector<int>& slices) {
        return solveTab(slices);
    }
};
```

### Approach 3: Space Optimization (SO)

#### Concept:
- The tabulation approach can be optimized further in terms of space.
- Instead of maintaining a 2D array, we only need three 1D arrays (`prev`, `curr`, and `next`) to store values for the current and previous states.
- This reduces the space complexity from `O(k * k/3)` to `O(k)`.

#### Explanation:
- For each case (considering slices from `0 to k-2` and `1 to k-1`), use three arrays:
  - `next`, `curr`, and `prev` to store results.
- Process the array from the last slice to the first, updating the arrays iteratively.

**Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
private:
    int solveSO(vector<int>& slices) {
        int k = slices.size();
        vector<int> prev1(k + 2, 0), curr1(k + 2, 0), next1(k + 2, 0);
        vector<int> prev2(k + 2, 0), curr2(k + 2, 0), next2(k + 2, 0);

        for (int index = k - 2; index >= 0; index--) {
            for (int n = 1; n <= k / 3; n++) {
                int take = slices[index] + next1[n - 1];
                int notTake = curr1[n];
                prev1[n] = max(take, notTake);
            }
            next1 = curr1;
            curr1 = prev1;
        }
        int case1 = curr1[k / 3];

        for (int index = k - 1; index >= 1; index--) {
            for (int n = 1; n <= k / 3; n++) {
                int take = slices[index] + next2[n - 1];
                int notTake = curr2[n];
                prev2[n] = max(take, notTake);
            }
            next2 = curr2;
            curr2 = prev2;
        }
        int case2 = curr2[k / 3];

        return max(case1, case2);
    }

public:
    int maxSizeSlices(vector<int>& slices) {
        return solveSO(slices);
    }
};
```
