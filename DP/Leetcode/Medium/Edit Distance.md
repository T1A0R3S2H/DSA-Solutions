### TLDR
#### Recursion Approach:
The recursive approach starts by comparing characters of the two strings (`word1` and `word2`) from the beginning. If the characters match, the function proceeds to the next pair of characters (i.e., `i+1` and `j+1`), making no operation. If the characters donâ€™t match, three operations are considered:
1. **Insert**: Add a character from `word2` to `word1` by moving to the next character in `word2` (`j+1`).
2. **Delete**: Remove a character from `word1` by moving to the next character in `word1` (`i+1`).
3. **Replace**: Replace the character in `word1` with the character in `word2`, then move to the next pair (`i+1`, `j+1`).
The function recursively explores all possible operations and returns the minimum number of operations required to transform `word1` into `word2`.

#### Memoization Approach:
To optimize the recursive solution, memoization is used. Instead of recalculating the result for the same state repeatedly, the results are stored in a 2D array (or dictionary) to avoid redundant calculations. Each state is defined by the pair of indices `i` and `j`, representing the positions in `word1` and `word2`. If a state has already been computed, its result is fetched from the memoization table, reducing the time complexity significantly. This reduces the time complexity from exponential (in the recursive approach) to polynomial.

#### Tabulation Approach:
In the tabulation approach, we solve the problem iteratively by filling up a 2D DP table. We initialize the base cases: transforming an empty string into another string requires as many insertions as the length of the second string, and vice versa for deletions. Then, we fill the table by considering each character pair `(i, j)` from both strings. For each pair, we calculate the minimum operations by considering insertions, deletions, and replacements, and update the DP table accordingly. The final result, the minimum number of operations, is stored in the bottom-right cell of the DP table. This approach guarantees an optimal solution in a bottom-up manner.

#### Space Optimized Approach:
The space-optimized version of the tabulation approach reduces the space complexity from O(m * n) to O(n) by using only two rows of the DP table. The current and previous rows are used to store intermediate results for the transformation of substrings of `word1` and `word2`. In each iteration, we only need the current row and the previous row to compute the next row. By alternating between these two rows, we can store just enough information to compute the final result, thereby optimizing space usage while retaining the time complexity of O(m * n).

### Explanation:
The problem requires us to convert one string (`word1`) into another string (`word2`) with the minimum number of operations. The allowed operations are:
1. Insert a character.
2. Delete a character.
3. Replace a character.

The solution employs dynamic programming with four functions:
1. **solveRec**: A recursive solution to solve the problem by exploring all possible operations.
2. **solveMem**: A memoized version of the recursive approach, storing the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.
3. **solveTab**: A tabulation-based dynamic programming approach that iteratively fills a DP table.
4. **solveSO**: A space-optimized version using only two rows to save memory.

### Time Complexity:
- **solveRec**: O(3^(m+n)) in the worst case, as it recursively explores all operations (insert, delete, replace) for each pair of characters.
- **solveMem**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. This is due to memoization that avoids recalculating the same subproblems multiple times.
- **solveTab**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. We fill an `m x n` DP table once.
- **solveSO**: O(m * n), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two strings. The space is optimized using two rows.

### Space Complexity:
- **solveRec**: O(m + n) due to the recursive stack space.
- **solveMem**: O(m * n) for the DP table used for memoization.
- **solveTab**: O(m * n) for the DP table.
- **solveSO**: O(n) for the two rows used in the space-optimized solution.

### Dry Run:
Let's do a full dry run for the tabulated approach using the example:

**Input:**
`word1 = "horse"`
`word2 = "ros"`

**Steps for solving with Tabulation:**

1. Initialize the DP table of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m = len(word1) = 5` and `n = len(word2) = 3`. The table will look like this initially:

   ```
   DP Table:
   [0, 1, 2, 3]
   [1, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 0, 0, 0]
   [3, 0, 0, 0]
   [4, 0, 0, 0]
   [5, 0, 0, 0]
   ```

2. Fill the base case:
   - If `i = m` and `j` varies from 0 to `n`, we initialize `dp[m][j] = n - j` (deletion operations).
   - If `j = n` and `i` varies from 0 to `m`, we initialize `dp[i][n] = m - i` (insertions).

   Updated table after the base cases:
   
   ```
   DP Table:
   [0, 1, 2, 3]
   [1, 0, 0, 0]
   [2, 0, 0, 0]
   [3, 0, 0, 0]
   [4, 0, 0, 0]
   [5, 4, 3, 2]
   ```

3. Now, we begin filling the table from bottom-right to top-left (for `i = m-1` to `0` and `j = n-1` to `0`). At each `dp[i][j]`, we choose the minimum cost operation:
   - If `word1[i] == word2[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j + 1]` (no operation needed).
   - Otherwise, we calculate:
     - `insertAns = 1 + dp[i][j + 1]` (insert operation),
     - `deleteAns = 1 + dp[i + 1][j]` (delete operation),
     - `replaceAns = 1 + dp[i + 1][j + 1]` (replace operation).
   - Take the minimum of the three.

4. **Step-by-step filling of the table:**

   **For i = 4 (`word1 = "e"`, word2 = "ros"):**
   - `dp[4][2] = min(1 + dp[4][3], 1 + dp[5][2], 1 + dp[5][3]) = min(1 + 3, 1 + 3, 1 + 2) = 3`
   - `dp[4][1] = min(1 + dp[4][2], 1 + dp[5][1], 1 + dp[5][2]) = min(1 + 3, 1 + 4, 1 + 3) = 4`
   - `dp[4][0] = min(1 + dp[4][1], 1 + dp[5][0], 1 + dp[5][1]) = min(1 + 4, 1 + 5, 1 + 4) = 5`

   **For i = 3 (`word1 = "s"`, word2 = "ros"):**
   - `dp[3][2] = min(1 + dp[3][3], 1 + dp[4][2], 1 + dp[4][3]) = min(1 + 2, 1 + 3, 1 + 3) = 3`
   - `dp[3][1] = min(1 + dp[3][2], 1 + dp[4][1], 1 + dp[4][2]) = min(1 + 3, 1 + 4, 1 + 3) = 4`
   - `dp[3][0] = min(1 + dp[3][1], 1 + dp[4][0], 1 + dp[4][1]) = min(1 + 4, 1 + 5, 1 + 4) = 5`

   **For i = 2 (`word1 = "r"`, word2 = "ros"):**
   - `dp[2][2] = min(1 + dp[2][3], 1 + dp[3][2], 1 + dp[3][3]) = min(1 + 1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2) = 2`
   - `dp[2][1] = min(1 + dp[2][2], 1 + dp[3][1], 1 + dp[3][2]) = min(1 + 2, 1 + 4, 1 + 3) = 3`
   - `dp[2][0] = min(1 + dp[2][1], 1 + dp[3][0], 1 + dp[3][1]) = min(1 + 3, 1 + 5, 1 + 4) = 4`

   **For i = 1 (`word1 = "o"`, word2 = "ros"):**
   - `dp[1][2] = min(1 + dp[1][3], 1 + dp[2][2], 1 + dp[2][3]) = min(1 + 0, 1 + 2, 1 + 1) = 1`
   - `dp[1][1] = min(1 + dp[1][2], 1 + dp[2][1], 1 + dp[2][2]) = min(1 + 1, 1 + 3, 1 + 2) = 2`
   - `dp[1][0] = min(1 + dp[1][1], 1 + dp[2][0], 1 + dp[2][1]) = min(1 + 2, 1 + 4, 1 + 3) = 3`

   **For i = 0 (`word1 = "h"`, word2 = "ros"):**
   - `dp[0][2] = min(1 + dp[0][3], 1 + dp[1][2], 1 + dp[1][3]) = min(1 + 3, 1 + 1, 1 + 0) = 1`
   - `dp[0][1] = min(1 + dp[0][2], 1 + dp[1][1], 1 + dp[1][2]) = min(1 + 1, 1 + 2, 1 + 1) = 2`
   - `dp[0][0] = min(1 + dp[0][1], 1 + dp[1][0], 1 + dp[1][1]) = min(1 + 2, 1 + 3, 1 + 2) = 3`

   **Final DP Table:**

   ```
   DP Table:
   [3, 2, 1, 3]
   [4, 2, 1, 2]
   [5, 3, 2, 1]
   [5, 4, 3, 1]
   [5, 4, 3, 2]
   [5, 4, 3, 2]
   ```

### Result:
The minimum number of operations required to convert `word1 = "horse"` to `word2 = "ros"` is stored at `dp[0][0]`, which is **3**. This corresponds to the following operations:
- Replace 'h' with 'r'
- Delete 'r'
- Delete 'e'
