**Code:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solveMem(int index, int buy, vector<int>& prices, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        int n = prices.size();
        if (index >= n) return 0; // Base case: if index is out of bounds, return 0.
        
        if (dp[index][buy] != -1) return dp[index][buy]; // Use cached result if available
        
        if (buy) {
            // Option to buy now or skip
            int buyProfit = -prices[index] + solveMem(index + 1, 0, prices, dp); // Buy and move to next day with sell option
            int skipProfit = solveMem(index + 1, 1, prices, dp); // Skip and retain buy option
            dp[index][buy] = max(buyProfit, skipProfit);
        } else {
            // Option to sell now with cooldown or skip
            int sellProfit = prices[index] + solveMem(index + 2, 1, prices, dp); // Sell and move with cooldown (index + 2)
            int skipProfit = solveMem(index + 1, 0, prices, dp); // Skip and retain sell option
            dp[index][buy] = max(sellProfit, skipProfit);
        }
        
        return dp[index][buy];
    }

    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int n = prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(2, -1)); // Initialize DP array
        return solveMem(0, 1, prices, dp); // Start with the option to buy
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**
- The problem requires finding the maximum profit from stock transactions with the restriction that after selling, a cooldown of one day is required before another buy can occur.
- The approach uses dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem by storing results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
- `solveMem` is a memoized recursive function that tracks two states:
  - `index`: The current day.
  - `buy`: A flag indicating whether the current action is to buy (1) or sell (0).
- The base case is when the index goes out of bounds, returning 0 (no profit).
- If the current state (index and buy) has already been computed, the cached result is returned to avoid redundant calculations.
- For the `buy` state (when the action is to buy), there are two options:
  - Buy the stock at the current price and move to the next day with the option to sell.
  - Skip buying and retain the buy option for the next day.
- For the `sell` state (when the action is to sell), there are two options:
  - Sell the stock at the current price and move to the day after the next day (because of the cooldown).
  - Skip selling and retain the sell option for the next day.
- The DP table is used to store results for each state (`index`, `buy`) to avoid recalculating the same state multiple times.

**Time Complexity:**
- Each state `(index, buy)` is computed once, and there are at most `2 * n` states (since `buy` can be 0 or 1 and `index` can range from 0 to `n-1`).
- Thus, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of days (the length of the `prices` array).

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the DP table, which stores results for `n` days and two possible states (`buy` or `sell`).

**Dry Run:**

Let's dry-run the code with the example `prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]`:

- Starting with `solveMem(0, 1)` (i.e., we can buy on day 0):
  - Option 1: Buy at price 1, then call `solveMem(1, 0)` (next day with the option to sell).
  - Option 2: Skip the buy, then call `solveMem(1, 1)` (next day with the option to buy).
  
- Recursively, the function explores all the options (buying, skipping, selling, etc.), caching results along the way. Eventually, the function returns the maximum profit of 3. The optimal transactions are:
  - Buy on day 0, sell on day 2, cooldown on day 3, and buy on day 4, then sell on day 4.
