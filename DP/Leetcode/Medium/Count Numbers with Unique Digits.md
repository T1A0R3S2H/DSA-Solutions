#### TLDR:
###### **Recursive Approach**:
- The function uses recursion to break the problem down into smaller subproblems by reducing \( n \) at each step. For each \( n \), it multiplies available choices for each digit to form valid numbers. The result for each length is accumulated recursively. **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) due to nested loops inside recursion. **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) due to the recursion stack.

###### **Tabulation Approach**:
- This approach uses dynamic programming to iteratively calculate the number of valid numbers for lengths from 0 to \( n \). A `dp[]` array stores intermediate results, and the function computes the valid numbers by multiplying available choices for each digit. **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) due to the loops. **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \) for storing the `dp[]` array. This is more efficient than recursion for larger values of \( n \).\


#### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solveRec(int n){
        if (n==0) return 1;
        if (n==1) return 10;
        int k=9;
        for (int i=0; i<n-1; i++) {
            k*=(9-i);
        }
        return k+solveRec(n-1);
    }

    int solveTab(int n) {
        if (n==0) return 1;
        vector<int> dp(n+1, 0);
        dp[0]=1;
        dp[1]=10;
        for (int i=2; i<=n; i++) {
            int uniqueDigits=9;
            int availableDigits=9;
            for (int j=1; j<i; j++) {
                uniqueDigits*=availableDigits--;
            }
            dp[i]=dp[i-1]+uniqueDigits;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }

    int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        // return solveRec(n);
        return solveTab(n);
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **solveRec (Recursive Approach)**:
   - **Base Case 1**: If \( n = 0 \), the only valid number is 0, so return 1.
   - **Base Case 2**: If \( n = 1 \), all digits from 0 to 9 are valid, so return 10.
   - For \( n > 1 \), calculate the number of valid numbers for that length by multiplying the number of available choices for each digit:
     - The first digit has 9 choices (from 1 to 9).
     - The second digit has 9 choices (from 0 to 9 but excluding the first digit).
     - The third digit has 8 choices, and so on.
   - The result for \( n \) is the product of these choices plus the result from the previous length \( n-1 \), which ensures that all numbers of length less than \( n \) are counted.

2. **solveTab (Tabulation Approach)**:
   - **Base Case 1**: If \( n = 0 \), return 1 because only the number 0 is valid.
   - **Base Case 2**: If \( n = 1 \), return 10 because numbers from 0 to 9 are valid.
   - For \( n > 1 \), compute the number of valid numbers for each length from \( 2 \) to \( n \) using the tabulation technique:
     - For each length \( i \), calculate the choices for the digits:
       - The first digit has 9 choices.
       - The second digit has 9 choices, and so on.
   - The result is stored in a dynamic programming array `dp`, where `dp[i]` stores the count for numbers of length \( i \).
   - Finally, return `dp[n]`, the result for length \( n \).
  
3. The idea behind the tabulation approach is to calculate the number of valid numbers of length \( n \) with **unique digits** while considering the available digits for each position.

### Explanation of the Process:

1. **First digit**:
   - For the first digit, we can choose any of the digits from 1 to 9 (i.e., 9 choices). The reason it's from 1 to 9 is that a number cannot start with 0 (for a non-zero length).

2. **Second digit**:
   - The second digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except the first digit. So, there are 9 available choices for the second digit (because one digit has already been used).

3. **Third digit**:
   - The third digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, except for the first and second digits. Therefore, there are 8 available choices.

4. **Subsequent digits**:
   - For each additional digit, we continue reducing the available choices by 1 each time, because the digits must be unique.

### In the Code:

```cpp
for (int j = 1; j < i; j++) {
    uniqueDigits *= availableDigits--;  // Decreases available choices
}
```

- `uniqueDigits` starts with the number of valid choices for the first digit, which is 9.
- As the loop progresses, the available choices are reduced (i.e., `availableDigits--`), and `uniqueDigits` is multiplied by the current number of available digits.
  
### Let's break it down:

1. **First iteration (j = 1)**: 
   - `uniqueDigits *= availableDigits--` where `availableDigits` is 9.
   - After the first iteration, `uniqueDigits` becomes \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \), and `availableDigits` becomes 8.

2. **Second iteration (j = 2)**: 
   - Now `uniqueDigits *= availableDigits--` where `availableDigits` is now 8.
   - After the second iteration, `uniqueDigits` becomes \( 81 \times 8 = 648 \), and `availableDigits` becomes 7.

3. This continues for each subsequent digit, with `availableDigits` decreasing by 1 each time to reflect the restriction that we cannot reuse digits.

### To Summarize:

- **`uniqueDigits`** keeps track of how many valid choices you have for each digit (starting with 9 for the first digit, and reducing as you go).
- **`availableDigits--`** reduces the available choices for subsequent digits, ensuring the uniqueness constraint is maintained. 

---

### Time Complexity:

- **solveRec**:
  - The function calls itself recursively, reducing the problem size by 1 each time (i.e., \( n \to n-1 \)).
  - Inside each call, there is a loop running for \( n \) iterations.
  - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \), because each recursive call involves a loop that runs for up to \( n-1 \) times. There are \( n \) recursive calls in total, each with a loop of decreasing size.

- **solveTab**:
  - The function uses dynamic programming and iterates over all numbers from \( 2 \) to \( n \). For each \( i \), there is a loop that runs \( i-1 \) times.
  - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \), because the outer loop runs \( n \) times, and the inner loop runs \( i-1 \) times for each \( i \).

- **countNumbersWithUniqueDigits**:
  - This function simply calls `solveTab(n)` or `solveRec(n)`. Hence, the time complexity is determined by the function it calls.

---

### Space Complexity:

- **solveRec**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(n) \), as it uses recursion, and each recursive call consumes space on the stack.

- **solveTab**:
  - The space complexity is \( O(n) \), as it uses a dynamic programming array of size \( n+1 \) to store intermediate results.

---

### Dry Run (For \( n = 2 \)):

#### Recursive Approach (`solveRec`):

- **Step 1**: Call `solveRec(2)`
  - \( n = 2 \), so we enter the loop for the first digit choices.
  - \( k = 9 \), then for \( i = 0 \), we multiply \( k \) by \( (9 - i) = 9 \), so \( k = 81 \).
  - Call `solveRec(1)`.
    - \( n = 1 \), so return 10 (Base case).
  - Return \( k + solveRec(1) = 81 + 10 = 91 \).

So, for \( n = 2 \), the result is 91.

#### Tabulation Approach (`solveTab`):

- **Step 1**: Call `solveTab(2)`
  - Initialize `dp = [1, 10, 0]`.
  - For \( i = 2 \):
    - Start with `uniqueDigits = 9` and `availableDigits = 9`.
    - For \( j = 1 \), multiply `uniqueDigits *= availableDigits--` -> `uniqueDigits = 81`.
    - Store `dp[2] = dp[1] + uniqueDigits = 10 + 81 = 91`.
  - Return `dp[2] = 91`.

So, for \( n = 2 \), the result is 91.

---

### Final Thoughts:

- The **recursive** solution is simpler but not optimal because of the recursion stack overhead and repeated calculations.
- The **tabulation** solution avoids repeated calculations and stores intermediate results, which is more efficient and prevents stack overflow for larger \( n \).
