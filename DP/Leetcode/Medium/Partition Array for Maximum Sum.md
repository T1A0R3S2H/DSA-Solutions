### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(vector<int>& arr, int k, int i, int maxi, int remaining, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        if (remaining==0 || i>=arr.size()) return 0;
        if (dp[remaining][i]!=-1) return dp[remaining][i];
        maxi=max(maxi, arr[i]);
        
        // Base case: if at the last element, return the result of the current partition
        if (i==arr.size()-1) return maxi*(k-remaining+1);

        // Include: Take the current partition and start a new one
        int include=maxi*(k-remaining+1)+solve(arr, k, i+1, 0, k, dp);

        // Exclude: Continue the current partition by moving to the next element
        int exclude=0+solve(arr, k, i+1, maxi, remaining-1, dp);

        return dp[remaining][i]=max(include, exclude);
    }

    int maxSumAfterPartitioning(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(k+1, vector<int>(arr.size(), -1));
        return solve(arr, k, 0, 0, k, dp);
    }
};

```

### Explanation:
The problem is essentially about partitioning an array into contiguous subarrays of length at most `k` and then maximizing the sum by replacing the elements in each partition with the maximum value of that partition.

#### Approach:
1. **Recursive Function (`solve`)**: 
   - This function takes the following parameters:
     - `arr`: The array of integers.
     - `k`: The maximum length of each subarray.
     - `i`: The current index in the array.
     - `maxi`: The maximum value of the current partition.
     - `remaining`: The number of partitions left to use.
     - `dp`: A memoization table to store results of subproblems.
     
   - **Base Case**: If no partitions remain or the index exceeds the array length, return `0`.
   - If the value for `dp[remaining][i]` is already computed, return the stored value to avoid recomputation.
   - **Include**: Start a new partition by taking the current element and resetting `maxi`, then recursively calculate the sum for the remaining elements.
   - **Exclude**: Continue the current partition, keeping the `maxi` as it is, and move to the next element.
   - The result for each `dp[remaining][i]` is the maximum of the two cases: `include` and `exclude`.

2. **Main Function (`maxSumAfterPartitioning`)**: 
   - Initializes a memoization table `dp` of size `(k + 1) x (arr.size())` and calls the `solve` function starting from index `0` with `k` remaining partitions.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N * K)`, where `N` is the length of the array (`arr.size()`) and `K` is the maximum number of partitions allowed (`k`). The solution uses memoization, so each subproblem (combination of index and remaining partitions) is solved at most once.
  
  - For each element in the array (`i` from 0 to `N-1`), you are trying all `K` possible remaining partitions, leading to a complexity of `O(N * K)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(N * K)` for the memoization table (`dp`), where `N` is the length of the array and `K` is the number of partitions. This is because the recursion explores all combinations of index and remaining partitions and stores the results in a table.

### Dry Run:

#### Input:
```cpp
arr = [1, 15, 7, 9, 2, 5, 10]
k = 3
```

1. **Initial Call**:
   - Call `solve(arr, k, 0, 0, 3, dp)`.
   - `maxi = 0`, `remaining = 3`.

2. **Exploring the Include Case**:
   - Start a new partition at index `i = 0` with value `1`. The maximum value in the partition so far is updated to `1`.
   - Move to index `i = 1` with `remaining = 3`.

3. **Explore Further**:
   - Continue exploring by either including or excluding the elements in each partition. For example, consider forming partitions `[15]`, `[7, 15]`, `[7, 9, 15]`, etc., until you finish processing the entire array.

4. **Base Case Reached**:
   - Once you reach the end of the array, return the computed maximum sum based on the subproblems solved so far.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The result of `dp[3][0]` will give the largest sum after partitioning, which is `84`.

### Conclusion:
This solution uses dynamic programming with memoization to solve the problem efficiently by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. It explores two choices at each step (whether to include or exclude an element in the partition) and uses memoization to avoid redundant computations.
