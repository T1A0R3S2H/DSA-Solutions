### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solveTab(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int n=prices.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int>(2, 0));
        for (int index=n-1; index>=0; index--) {
            for (int buy=0; buy<=1; buy++) {
                int profit=0;
                if (buy) {
                    profit = max((-prices[index]+dp[index+1][0]),
                                 (dp[index+1][1]));
                } 
                else {
                    profit=max((prices[index]+dp[index+1][1]-fee),
                                 (dp[index+1][0]));
                }
                dp[index][buy]=profit;
            }
        }
        return dp[0][1];
    }

    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        return solveTab(prices, fee);
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize profit from stock transactions where each buy and sell incurs a fee. You can perform as many transactions as you like, but each one is subject to the fee.
- **Approach**: Use dynamic programming to track the profit for each day whether we are holding the stock (`buy = 1`) or not holding it (`buy = 0`).
  - `dp[index][0]` represents the maximum profit on or after day `index` when we are not holding the stock.
  - `dp[index][1]` represents the maximum profit on or after day `index` when we are holding the stock.
  - For each day, we decide whether to buy, sell, or do nothing, based on the profit calculations that include the transaction fee.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The solution involves iterating through the prices array once and performing constant-time operations for each element. Hence, the time complexity is linear in terms of the number of days (prices).

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use a 2D DP table of size `n x 2` to store the profit values for each day, where `n` is the length of the `prices` array.

### Dry Run:
Letâ€™s take the example `prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9]` and `fee = 2`.

- **Day 5 (prices[5] = 9)**:
  - If we have the stock (buy = 1), we can't make a profit since we are at the last day.
  - If we don't have the stock (buy = 0), the profit is 0.
  
- **Day 4 (prices[4] = 4)**:
  - If we have the stock (buy = 1), the best option is to hold, giving us a profit of 0.
  - If we sell the stock, the profit would be `9 - 4 - 2 = 3`.

- Similarly, we proceed backward, updating the `dp` table, and finally, at day 0, we get the maximum profit by holding the stock, which is 8.

The final profit is 8, which is the expected output.
