### 1. Recursive Approach (`solveRec`)

```cpp
int solveRec(int start, int end){
    if(start >= end) return 0; // Base case: no cost if only one number
    int ans = INT_MAX; // Initialize the answer to the maximum integer
    for(int i = start; i <= end; i++){
        ans = min(ans, i + max(solveRec(start, i - 1), solveRec(i + 1, end))); // Calculate cost
    }
    return ans; // Return the minimum cost
}
```

#### Explanation:
- This function is a pure recursive solution to find the minimum amount of money needed to guarantee a win in the guessing game.
- It checks every possible guess between `start` and `end`.
- For each guess `i`, it calculates the total cost as the sum of `i` (the cost of the current guess) and the maximum of the costs incurred from the left and right ranges.
- The base case returns `0` if the range has one or no numbers.

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(2^n)**: In the worst case, the function explores all combinations of guesses, leading to exponential growth.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is determined by the depth of the recursion stack.

#### Dry Run:
- For `n = 3`, the function would recursively evaluate guesses:
  - If guessing `1`, it explores `[2, 3]` and calculates costs for `2` and `3`.
  - It continues this pattern, eventually returning the minimum cost through the recursive calls.

### 2. Memoization Approach (`solveMem`)

```cpp
int solveMem(int start, int end, vector<vector<int>>& dp){
    if(start >= end) return 0; // Base case: no cost if only one number
    if(dp[start][end] != -1) return dp[start][end]; // Return cached result if available
    int ans = INT_MAX; // Initialize the answer to the maximum integer
    for(int i = start; i <= end; i++){
        ans = min(ans, i + max(solveMem(start, i - 1, dp), solveMem(i + 1, end, dp))); // Calculate cost
    }
    return dp[start][end] = ans; // Store result in dp table and return
}
```

#### Explanation:
- This function improves upon the recursive approach by using memoization to store previously computed results in the `dp` table.
- The logic is similar to `solveRec`, but it checks if a result for the range `[start, end]` has already been computed to avoid redundant calculations.

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: Each subproblem `(start, end)` is solved once, leading to a quadratic number of states.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: The space required for the `dp` table that stores results for each subproblem.

#### Dry Run:
- For `n = 3`, the function fills the `dp` table:
  - It starts with small ranges and builds up to `[1, 3]`, caching results to avoid recomputation.
  - For example, `dp[1][2]` might be calculated first, then reused for `dp[1][3]`.

### 3. Tabulation Approach (`solveTab`)

```cpp
int solveTab(int n) {
    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 2, vector<int>(n + 2, 0)); // Initialize dp array

    for (int start = n; start >= 1; start--) {
        for (int end = start; end <= n; end++) {
            if (start == end) continue; // No cost for a single number
            int ans = INT_MAX; // Initialize answer

            // Iterate through all possible guesses
            for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
                int leftCost = dp[start][i - 1]; // Cost of the left side
                int rightCost = dp[i + 1][end]; // Cost of the right side

                // Avoid overflow
                if (i - 1 < start) leftCost = 0; // No left range
                if (i + 1 > end) rightCost = 0; // No right range

                ans = min(ans, i + max(leftCost, rightCost)); // Calculate total cost
            }
            dp[start][end] = ans; // Store the result in dp table
        }
    }
    return dp[1][n]; // Return the result for the full range [1, n]
}
```

#### Explanation:
- This function uses tabulation (bottom-up dynamic programming) to compute the minimum cost required to guarantee a win.
- It initializes a 2D `dp` table and iteratively fills it by calculating costs for all ranges `[start, end]`.
- The function examines each possible guess `i`, calculates the associated costs, and updates the `dp` table accordingly.

#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n^3)**: The function includes three nested loops: two for the start and end ranges and one for the guesses.

#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n^2)**: The `dp` table stores results for each subproblem.

#### Dry Run:
- For `n = 3`, the outer loops fill the `dp` table:
  - It first calculates costs for ranges like `[1, 2]`, `[1, 3]`, and so forth.
  - The final result for the range `[1, 3]` is found in `dp[1][3]`.

### Summary of Functions

- **`solveRec`**: A pure recursive approach with exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems. It serves as a baseline but is inefficient for larger values of `n`.
  
- **`solveMem`**: An improved recursive approach using memoization, significantly reducing time complexity to \(O(n^2)\) while maintaining the recursive structure.

- **`solveTab`**: A tabulated approach that fills a dynamic programming table iteratively, which is generally more efficient in terms of space and avoids the overhead of recursive calls. The time complexity is higher due to the three nested loops, but it provides a direct and efficient computation for all ranges.

### Integration in `getMoneyAmount`
In the `getMoneyAmount` function, you can uncomment any of the approaches you wish to test:
- Call `solveRec(1, n)` for the recursive solution.
- Call `solveMem(1, n, dp)` for the memoization solution.
- Call `solveTab(n)` for the tabulation solution.

This structure gives you flexibility in analyzing the performance of each approach.

The overall most efficient approach among the three is the **Memoization Approach (`solveMem`)**. Here's a breakdown of why it is considered the most efficient:

### Efficiency Comparison

1. **Recursive Approach (`solveRec`)**
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\) due to the exponential growth of recursive calls.
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the recursion stack.
   - **Efficiency**: While it provides a straightforward implementation, it suffers from repeated calculations of the same subproblems, making it highly inefficient for larger values of \(n\).

2. **Memoization Approach (`solveMem`)**
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) because each subproblem `(start, end)` is computed once and stored.
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) for the `dp` table.
   - **Efficiency**: This approach optimally uses the benefits of recursion while avoiding redundant computations. It strikes a balance between clarity and efficiency, making it suitable for \(n\) up to 200, as specified in the problem constraints.

3. **Tabulation Approach (`solveTab`)**
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\) due to the three nested loops (for `start`, `end`, and `guess`).
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) for the `dp` table.
   - **Efficiency**: Although it systematically fills the table and guarantees that each subproblem is solved, its time complexity is higher than the memoization approach, making it less efficient in comparison.

### Conclusion
- **Most Efficient**: **Memoization Approach (`solveMem`)**
  - It provides a significant improvement over the recursive method by reducing the time complexity from exponential to polynomial while maintaining the recursive structure, which can be easier to understand and implement.
  
If you want the best trade-off between efficiency and implementation simplicity for this problem, the memoization approach is the way to go. It allows you to handle the upper limits of \(n\) effectively within the constraints provided.
