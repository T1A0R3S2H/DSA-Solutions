### **Problem Understanding**

We are tasked with finding the length of the longest possible word chain from an array of words. A word chain is a sequence of words where each word is a **predecessor** of the next word. A word is a predecessor of another if we can add exactly **one character** to the first word to get the second word while maintaining the order of characters.

### **Approach Overview**
#### 1. **`matching` Function**
**Mahatva**:  
- This function determines whether a word `s1` is a **valid predecessor** of another word `s2`.
- It ensures that `s2` can be formed by adding exactly one letter to `s1`, while keeping all other characters in the same order.

**Logic**:
- If the length of `s2` is not exactly one more than `s1`, return `false` immediately.
- Compare characters of `s1` and `s2`:
  - If the characters match, move both pointers forward.
  - If they don’t match, skip one character in `s2` (allowed only once).
- Return `true` only if the difference is **exactly one character**.

---

#### 2. **`longestStrChain` Function**
**Mahatva**:
- This is the main driver function that calculates the **length of the longest word chain**.
- It coordinates the solution by:
  1. **Sorting** the words by length.
  2. **Using dynamic programming (DP)** to compute the longest chain.
  3. Utilizing the `matching` function to check valid predecessors.

---

1. **`matching` Function**:  
   This checks whether one word is a valid predecessor of another. It ensures the difference in lengths is exactly 1, and we can add one character in the right position to the smaller word to match the larger word.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:  
   - Use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the length of the longest word chain ending with the word at index `i`.
   - Iterate through all pairs of words. If one word is a predecessor of another, update the `dp` value for the longer word.
   - The final answer is the maximum value in the `dp` array.

3. **Sorting the Words**:  
   - To ensure the chain-building process works correctly, we first sort the words by their lengths. This way, smaller words are processed before longer ones, ensuring valid predecessors are considered.

### **Code**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    // Function to check if s1 is a predecessor of s2
    bool matching(string s1, string s2) {
        if (s2.length() - s1.length() != 1) return false;

        int i = 0, j = 0; // Pointers for s1 and s2
        bool skipped = false;

        while (i < s1.length() && j < s2.length()) {
            if (s1[i] == s2[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                if (skipped) return false;
                skipped = true;
                j++;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        int n = words.size();

        // Step 1: Sort words by length
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [](string &a, string &b) {
            return a.size() < b.size();
        });

        // Step 2: Initialize DP array
        vector<int> dp(n, 1); // Every word can at least form a chain of length 1
        int maxChain = 1;

        // Step 3: Build DP array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (matching(words[j], words[i])) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            maxChain = max(maxChain, dp[i]);
        }

        return maxChain;
    }
};
```

### **Function Mahatva (Importance)**

1. **`matching` Function**:  
   - Validates the fundamental condition for a word chain: whether one word is a predecessor of another.  
   - Ensures correctness in forming chains and avoids unnecessary calculations.

2. **`longestStrChain` Function**:  
   - Combines sorting and dynamic programming to calculate the longest chain.  
   - Sorts the words to ensure the predecessor relationship is checked correctly.  
   - Uses a `dp` array to store subproblem results, avoiding redundant computations.

---

### **Time Complexity**

1. **Sorting**:  
   - Sorting the words by length takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of words.

2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**:  
   - Outer loop iterates over \(n\) words.  
   - Inner loop iterates over all previous words (\(O(n)\) in the worst case).  
   - For each pair, the `matching` function runs in \(O(\text{word length})\), which is at most \(O(16)\).  
   - Total: \(O(n^2 \cdot 16) = O(n^2)\).

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\).

---

### **Space Complexity**

1. **Sorting**: No additional space beyond the input list (in-place sort).  
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Requires \(O(n)\) space for the `dp` array.  

**Overall Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\).

### **Detailed Dry Run**

#### **Input**:  
`words = ["a", "b", "ba", "bca", "bda", "bdca"]`

#### **Step 1: Sorting**  
Sorted `words`: `["a", "b", "ba", "bca", "bda", "bdca"]`

#### **Step 2: DP Initialization**  
`dp = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` (Each word is a chain of at least length 1).  
`maxChain = 1`

#### **Step 3: Build DP Table**

1. **Outer Loop \(i = 1\) ("b")**:  
   - Compare with `j = 0` ("a"):  
     - `matching("a", "b") = false` → No update.

2. **Outer Loop \(i = 2\) ("ba")**:  
   - Compare with `j = 0` ("a"):  
     - `matching("a", "ba") = true` → Update: `dp[2] = max(1, dp[0] + 1) = 2`.  
   - Compare with `j = 1` ("b"):  
     - `matching("b", "ba") = true` → Update: `dp[2] = max(2, dp[1] + 1) = 2`.  

   `dp = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]`

3. **Outer Loop \(i = 3\) ("bca")**:  
   - Compare with `j = 0` ("a"):  
     - `matching("a", "bca") = false`.  
   - Compare with `j = 1` ("b"):  
     - `matching("b", "bca") = false`.  
   - Compare with `j = 2` ("ba"):  
     - `matching("ba", "bca") = true` → Update: `dp[3] = max(1, dp[2] + 1) = 3`.

   `dp = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1]`

4. **Outer Loop \(i = 4\) ("bda")**:  
   - Compare with `j = 0` ("a"):  
     - `matching("a", "bda") = false`.  
   - Compare with `j = 1` ("b"):  
     - `matching("b", "bda") = false`.  
   - Compare with `j = 2` ("ba"):  
     - `matching("ba", "bda") = true` → Update: `dp[4] = max(1, dp[2] + 1) = 3`.  
   - Compare with `j = 3` ("bca"):  
     - `matching("bca", "bda") = false`.  

   `dp = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1]`

5. **Outer Loop \(i = 5\) ("bdca")**:  
   - Compare with `j = 0` ("a"):  
     - `matching("a", "bdca") = false`.  
   - Compare with `j = 1` ("b"):  
     - `matching("b", "bdca") = false`.  
   - Compare with `j = 2` ("ba"):  
     - `matching("ba", "bdca") = false`.  
   - Compare with `j = 3` ("bca"):  
     - `matching("bca", "bdca") = true` → Update: `dp[5] = max(1, dp[3] + 1) = 4`.  
   - Compare with `j = 4` ("bda"):  
     - `matching("bda", "bdca") = true` → Update: `dp[5] = max(4, dp[4] + 1) = 4`.

   `dp = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`

---

**Final Answer**: `maxChain = 4`  

**Longest Word Chain**: `["a", "ba", "bda", "bdca"]`
