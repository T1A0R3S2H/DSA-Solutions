**Explanation:**
- The problem is about selecting the minimum cost to cover all the given travel days using three types of passes.
- There are three main approaches implemented:
  1. **solveMem**: A recursive approach with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.
  2. **solveTab**: An iterative bottom-up tabulation approach to fill up the dp array.
  3. **solveSO**: Space-optimized approach using two queues to keep track of valid 7-day and 30-day passes and their respective costs.

**Time Complexity:**
- **solveMem**: O(n), where n is the number of days. Each day is processed once due to memoization.
- **solveTab**: O(n), where n is the number of days. Each day is processed once in reverse order.
- **solveSO**: O(n), where n is the number of days. Each day is processed once with queue operations being constant time.

**Space Complexity:**
- **solveMem**: O(n) for the dp array and recursive call stack.
- **solveTab**: O(n) for the dp array.
- **solveSO**: O(n) for storing days in the two queues.

**Dry Run:**

For **Input: `days = [1,4,6,7,8,20]`, `costs = [2,7,15]`**:

- On day 1: Choose a 1-day pass costing 2.
- On day 3: Choose a 7-day pass covering days 3 to 9, costing 7.
- On day 20: Choose a 1-day pass costing 2.
- The total minimum cost is `2 + 7 + 2 = 11`.

in the tabulation, why return dp[0] only?

In the tabulation approach (solveTab), we are building the dp array where each element dp[index] represents the minimum cost to cover all the days starting from day index up to the end of the trip.

The array dp is filled in reverse order, starting from the last day (which is n, the size of the days array).
At each index, the minimum cost to cover the remaining days is computed by considering the three types of passes (1-day, 7-day, 30-day).
So, by the time we finish filling the dp array, dp[0] will contain the minimum cost required to cover all travel days starting from day 0, which is exactly what we need to return.

Here’s a breakdown of why dp[0] is returned:

Meaning of dp[0]:

dp[0] is the minimum cost to cover all the days starting from the first travel day (i.e., the beginning of the trip).
It's the optimal solution to the entire problem because it answers the question: "What is the minimum cost to travel from the first day to the last day?"
How it's computed:

The array is populated backwards from the end of the trip (dp[n] = 0, meaning there’s no cost beyond the last travel day).
For each day at index i, we calculate the minimum cost if we buy:
A 1-day pass starting at days[i].
A 7-day pass starting at days[i].
A 30-day pass starting at days[i].
We take the minimum of these options and store it in dp[i].
Why not return any other dp[i]?

Any other dp[i] represents the minimum cost to cover the days starting from day i onwards.
Since we are interested in the cost from the very first day (days[0]), dp[0] is the correct answer.
Thus, returning dp[0] gives the total minimum cost to cover all the days in the travel plan.
