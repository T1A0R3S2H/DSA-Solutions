### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(int n, vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs, int index, vector<int>& dp){
        if (index>=n) {
            return 0;
        }

        if (dp[index] != -1) {
            return dp[index];
        }

        // 1-day pass
        int opt1=costs[0]+solve(n, days, costs, index+1, dp);

        // 7-day pass
        int i;
        for (i=index; i<n && days[i]<days[index]+7; i++);
        int opt2=costs[1]+solve(n, days, costs, i, dp);

        // 30-day pass
        for (i=index; i<n && days[i]<days[index]+30; i++);
        int opt3=costs[2]+solve(n, days, costs, i, dp);
        
        dp[index]=min(opt1, min(opt2, opt3));
        return dp[index];
    }

    int mincostTickets(vector<int>& days, vector<int>& costs) {
        int n=days.size();
        int index=0;
        vector<int> dp(n, -1);
        return solve(n, days, costs, 0, dp);
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
- **Function `solve`**: This is a recursive function that calculates the minimum cost starting from a specific index in the `days` array. It uses memoization to avoid recalculating results for previously computed states.
  - **Base Case**: If the `index` is greater than or equal to `n` (i.e., all travel days have been processed), return `0` because there are no costs left.
  - **Memoization Check**: If the result for the current index has already been computed (`dp[index] != -1`), return the stored value to save computation time.
  - **Calculating Costs**:
    - **1-day pass** (`opt1`): Adds the cost of a 1-day pass and recursively calls `solve` for the next day (`index + 1`).
    - **7-day pass** (`opt2`): Uses a loop to find the first day that is **not** covered by the 7-day pass (which starts from `days[index]`). This is done by incrementing `i` until `days[i] >= days[index] + 7`. The recursive call uses this new index `i`.
    - **30-day pass** (`opt3`): Similar logic applies for the 30-day pass. It finds the first day not covered by incrementing `i` until `days[i] >= days[index] + 30`. The recursive call again uses this new index `i`.
  - **Store and Return Minimum Cost**: After calculating the costs for all options, the minimum cost is stored in `dp[index]` for future reference.

- **Function `mincostTickets`**: This is the entry point for calculating the minimum cost.
  - It initializes a memoization array `dp` of size `n` with all values set to `-1` (indicating uncomputed states).
  - It calls the helper function `solve` starting from index `0` and returns the result.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The function processes each day only once, and with memoization, it avoids recalculating for the same index multiple times.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The space complexity is due to the `dp` array used for memoization and the call stack for recursion, which can go as deep as `n` in the worst case.

### Dry Run:
Letâ€™s dry run with the example `days = [1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 20]` and `costs = [2, 7, 15]`.

1. Start with `index = 0` (day 1):
   - **1-day pass**: Cost = `2` + `solve(1, ...)`
   - **7-day pass**: Covers days 1 to 7. Call `solve` from day 20 (the first uncovered day).
   - **30-day pass**: Covers days 1 to 30. Call `solve` from day 31.

2. For each recursive call, follow the same logic:
   - Evaluate options for each day recursively.
   - Return the minimum costs computed for those options.

3. Eventually, you'll reach the base case and backtrack, filling in the `dp` array with the minimum costs calculated at each index.

# IMPORTANTðŸ”¥
In dynamic programming (DP), how you initialize your DP array can greatly affect the correctness and performance of your solution. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation focusing on when to initialize your DP array with specific values, particularly in the context of the **Minimum Cost for Tickets** problem.

#### Initialization Values in Dynamic Programming:

1. **Using `-1` for Memoization:**
   - In **memoization** (the approach used in your solution), we use a recursive strategy and cache results to avoid redundant computations.
   - **Initialization with `-1`** indicates that a certain state (or index) has not yet been computed. This allows the algorithm to check if a result is already available.
   - When the algorithm processes a state for the first time, it calculates the result, stores it in the DP array, and future calls can immediately retrieve this value without recalculating.

2. **Using `INT_MAX` for Tabulation:**
   - In **tabulation** (the bottom-up approach), the DP array is typically initialized to `INT_MAX` when you are looking to find a minimum.
   - The reason for using `INT_MAX` is that you want a very high starting point to ensure that any valid value computed later will be less than this initial value. This is particularly useful when you are trying to minimize over all the calculated values.
   - During the calculation process, as you fill up the DP table, you would replace instances of `INT_MAX` with the actual minimum values.

### Summary:
- **Memoization (Top-Down)**: Initialize the DP array with `-1` to indicate uncomputed states. This is suitable when you're directly storing minimum values during recursive calls.
- **Tabulation (Bottom-Up)**: Initialize the DP array with `INT_MAX` to facilitate finding the minimum value when filling the DP table.

### Specific to Your Problem:
In the **Minimum Cost for Tickets** problem:
- The DP array is initialized with `-1`, which is correct for your recursive (memoization) approach. This indicates that none of the states have been calculated yet.
- The recursion will naturally find and store the minimum cost for each index, so there is no need for an initial value of `INT_MAX`.

### Clarifying Your Confusion:
1. **Why Not Use `INT_MAX`?** 
   - Since you're using a top-down approach, initializing with `INT_MAX` is unnecessary because you arenâ€™t directly minimizing the values in a loop; instead, you're finding minimums through recursion and caching results. The function call structure ensures that you only compute values as needed, and thus the `-1` initialization is more intuitive for tracking unvisited states.

2. **When to Use Each?**
   - Use `-1` for memoization to signify uncomputed values.
   - Use `INT_MAX` in tabulation when you're actively looking for a minimum value to replace.

### Final Thoughts:
Understanding when to use `-1` versus `INT_MAX` is fundamental in dynamic programming. With experience, you'll find it easier to choose the appropriate initialization based on whether your approach is recursive or iterative. For your current implementation, continuing with `-1` for unvisited states in memoization is the right choice.

### Final Output:
- For the input `days = [1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 20]` and `costs = [2, 7, 15]`, the minimum cost calculated by the program is `11`, which is achieved by purchasing passes optimally to cover all travel days.
