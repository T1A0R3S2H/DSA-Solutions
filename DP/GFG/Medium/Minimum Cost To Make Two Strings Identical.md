#### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solveMem(string &x, string &y, int i, int j, int costX, int costY, vector<vector<int>> &dp) {
        if (i == x.size()) {
            return (y.size() - j) * costY;
        }
        if (j == y.size()) {
            return (x.size() - i) * costX;
        }
        if (dp[i][j] != -1) return dp[i][j];

        if (x[i] == y[j]) {
            return dp[i][j] = solveMem(x, y, i + 1, j + 1, costX, costY, dp);
        } else {
            int deleteX = costX + solveMem(x, y, i + 1, j, costX, costY, dp);
            int deleteY = costY + solveMem(x, y, i, j + 1, costX, costY, dp);
            return dp[i][j] = min(deleteX, deleteY);
        }
    }

    int findMinCost(string x, string y, int costX, int costY) {
        int n = x.size();
        int m = y.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(m, -1));
        return solveMem(x, y, 0, 0, costX, costY, dp);
    }
};
```

#### Explanation:
- We are given two strings `x` and `y`, and the costs of deleting characters from each string, `costX` and `costY`, respectively. The task is to determine the minimum cost to make the two strings identical by deleting characters from both strings.
- The dynamic programming approach is used here to break down the problem into subproblems. We calculate the minimum cost of making substrings of `x` and `y` identical, and build the solution step by step.
  
#### Time Complexity:
- **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the length of string `x` and `m` is the length of string `y`. This is because we are solving the problem using a 2D DP table of size `n * m`. Each state in the DP table is computed only once.
  
#### Space Complexity:
- **O(n * m)** for the DP table that stores the results for all subproblems.
