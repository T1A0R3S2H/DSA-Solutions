### TL;DR:
The function checks if there is a subset of the array `arr` whose sum equals the given target. It uses dynamic programming (DP) to memoize previously computed results to optimize recursive calls.

### CETSD (Code + ETSD):

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    bool subsetSumUtil(int ind, int target, vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& dp) {
        if (target == 0) return true; // If target sum is 0, subset exists
        if (ind == 0) return arr[0] == target; // Only one element left, check if it equals target
        if (dp[ind][target] != -1) // Return cached result if already computed
            return dp[ind][target];
        
        // Option 1: Do not include current element
        bool notTaken = subsetSumUtil(ind - 1, target, arr, dp);
        
        // Option 2: Include current element if it doesn't exceed target
        bool taken = false;
        if (arr[ind] <= target)
            taken = subsetSumUtil(ind - 1, target - arr[ind], arr, dp);
        
        // Memoize the result and return
        return dp[ind][target] = notTaken || taken;
    }
    
    bool isSubsetSum(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(target + 1, -1)); // DP table initialized to -1
        return subsetSumUtil(n - 1, target, arr, dp); // Start from last index
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base cases:**
   - If the target is 0, the subset sum exists (return true).
   - If there's only one element left (index 0), check if it matches the target.

2. **Recursive cases:**
   - Try to find a subset without taking the current element (`notTaken`).
   - Try to find a subset by including the current element, but only if it doesn't exceed the target (`taken`).
   
3. **Memoization:**  
   - If a subset sum for a given index and target is already calculated (i.e., `dp[ind][target] != -1`), return the cached result.
   
4. **DP Table Initialization:**  
   - The 2D DP table `dp` stores the results of the recursive calls. It's initialized with -1, meaning no state has been computed yet.

5. **Final call:**  
   - The function is called starting from the last index (`n - 1`), and the target sum is passed as a parameter.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time complexity:** O(n * target), where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `target` is the target sum. This comes from the size of the DP table.
  
### Space Complexity:
- **Space complexity:** O(n * target) for the DP table.

### Dry Run:
Letâ€™s dry-run the function for an example:

**Input:** `arr = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]`, `target = 9`

1. Start at `ind = 5` (last index). Target is 9.
2. Check the first option (do not take `arr[5]`), recursively call with `ind = 4` and target 9.
3. Check if taking `arr[5] = 2` results in a valid subset by calling `ind = 4` and target = 7.
4. Continue checking all possibilities by either taking or not taking each element.
5. Eventually, find that `arr[0] = 3`, `arr[1] = 34`, and `arr[2] = 4` give a subset sum of 9.

In the memoized table, intermediate results are stored to avoid redundant computation.
