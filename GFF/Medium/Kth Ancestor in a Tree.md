Your approach to finding the kth ancestor in a binary tree is correct. You can traverse the tree from the root to the given node and store the path in a vector. Once the path is found, you can easily determine the kth ancestor by accessing the appropriate element in the vector.

Here's how you can implement this approach in C++:

1. Perform a depth-first search (DFS) to find the path from the root to the given node and store the nodes in a vector.
2. Once you have the path, if the kth ancestor exists, return the corresponding element from the vector; otherwise, return -1 (false).

Here is the complete implementation:

```cpp
// Helper function to find the path from the root to the given node
bool findPath(Node* root, vector<int> &path, int node) {
    if (root == NULL) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Add current node to the path
    path.push_back(root->data);
    
    // Check if the current node is the target node
    if (root->data == node) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // Recursively check the left and right subtrees
    if ((root->left && findPath(root->left, path, node)) || 
        (root->right && findPath(root->right, path, node))) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // If the target node is not found, remove the current node from the path
    path.pop_back();
    return false;
}

int kthAncestor(Node *root, int k, int node) {
    vector<int> path;
    
    // Find the path from the root to the given node
    if (!findPath(root, path, node)) {
        return -1;
    }
    
    // The kth ancestor is the (size-k-1)th element in the path
    int index = path.size() - k - 1;
    if (index >= 0) {
        return path[index];
    }
    
    return -1;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **findPath Function:**
   - This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to find the path from the root to the given node.
   - It takes the root of the tree, a vector to store the path, and the target node as input.
   - The function adds the current node to the path and checks if it is the target node.
   - If the target node is found, it returns `true`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively searches the left and right subtrees.
   - If the target node is not found in either subtree, it removes the current node from the path and returns `false`.

2. **kthAncestor Function:**
   - This function uses the `findPath` function to get the path from the root to the given node.
   - It calculates the index of the kth ancestor by subtracting `k+1` from the size of the path.
   - If the index is valid (i.e., greater than or equal to 0), it returns the kth ancestor.
   - If the index is invalid, it returns `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- **findPath Function:**
  - In the worst case, the function will visit all nodes of the tree once. Hence, the time complexity is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  
- **kthAncestor Function:**
  - This function mainly relies on `findPath` and performs constant time operations after that. Hence, its time complexity is also \(O(N)\).

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(N)\).

### Space Complexity

- **findPath Function:**
  - The space complexity is dominated by the recursive call stack and the path vector.
  - In the worst case, the depth of the recursion will be equal to the height of the tree, which can be \(O(N)\) for a skewed tree.
  - The path vector will also store up to \(N\) nodes in the worst case.
  - Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(N)\).

- **kthAncestor Function:**
  - This function mainly uses the space allocated for the path vector and the recursion stack of `findPath`. Thus, its space complexity is also \(O(N)\).

Overall, the space complexity of the solution is \(O(N)\).

### Dry Run

Let's dry run the code with the sample input:

**Input:** \( k = 2 \), \( node = 4 \)

**Tree Structure:**
```
      1
    /   \
   2     3
  / \
 4   5
```

1. **findPath(root, path, node):**
   - Start at root (1):
     - Path: [1]
     - Node 1 is not the target node.
     - Recursively search the left subtree.
   - Move to node 2:
     - Path: [1, 2]
     - Node 2 is not the target node.
     - Recursively search the left subtree.
   - Move to node 4:
     - Path: [1, 2, 4]
     - Node 4 is the target node.
     - Return `true` up the recursion stack.

2. **kthAncestor(root, k, node):**
   - Path from root to node 4: [1, 2, 4]
   - Calculate the index of the 2nd ancestor: `path.size() - k - 1 = 3 - 2 - 1 = 0`
   - The 0th element in the path is 1.
   - Return 1.

**Output:** 1

The dry run shows that the 2nd ancestor of node 4 is correctly identified as node 1.
