Here's the code with some explanations and proper markdown formatting:

```cpp
class Solution
{
    public:
    // Function to return a list of nodes visible from the top view 
    // from left to right in Binary Tree.
    vector<int> topView(Node *root)
    {
        map<int,int> v; // Map to store vertical height index and node data

        vector<int> a; // Vector to store the result
        if(!root) return a; // If the root is null, return an empty vector

        queue<pair<Node*,int>> q; // Queue to perform level order traversal
        q.push({root,0}); // Initialize the queue with the root node and its vertical height (0)
 
        while(q.size()){
            Node *t = q.front().first; // Get the front node
            int vh = q.front().second; // Get the vertical height of the front node
            q.pop(); // Remove the front node from the queue
            
            // If this column index already has a node, we don't need to change it 
            if(v[vh]==0) v[vh]=t->data; // If this vertical height is not in the map, add it 
            
            if(t->left) q.push({t->left,vh-1}); // Push the left child with vertical height vh-1
            if(t->right) q.push({t->right,vh+1}); // Push the right child with vertical height vh+1
        }
        
        // All the nodes in the map are the nodes which are 
        // encountered first in the vertical traversal so they give us the top view of the tree
        for(auto x:v) a.push_back(x.second); // Add the nodes to the result vector
        
        return a; // Return the result
    }
};
```

### Explanation
- **Map `v`**: Stores the first node's data encountered at each vertical height.
- **Queue `q`**: Used for level order traversal, where each element is a pair consisting of a node and its vertical height.
- **Condition `if(v[vh]==0)`**: Ensures only the first node encountered at each vertical height is added to the map.
- **Traversal**:
  - Start with the root node at vertical height 0.
  - For each node, if its left child exists, push it to the queue with a vertical height of `vh-1`.
  - If its right child exists, push it to the queue with a vertical height of `vh+1`.
- **Result Construction**: Extract values from the map to form the final result representing the top view of the binary tree.

   # OR
### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
    - We initialize an empty vector `ans` to store the result.
    - We check if the root is `NULL`. If it is, we return the empty vector `ans`.
    - We create a `map<int, int> topNode` to store the top view nodes. The key is the horizontal distance (HD) from the root, and the value is the node's data at that HD.
    - We create a queue `q` of pairs, where each pair contains a node and its corresponding horizontal distance. We start by pushing the root node with an HD of 0.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    - We perform a BFS to explore the tree level by level.
    - For each node, we:
        - Extract the front node from the queue.
        - Check if the current horizontal distance (`hd`) is already present in the `topNode` map. If it isn't, we add the node's data to the map with its HD. This ensures that only the first (topmost) node encountered at each HD is recorded.
        - If the current node has a left child, we push it onto the queue with an HD of `hd - 1`.
        - If the current node has a right child, we push it onto the queue with an HD of `hd + 1`.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
    - After the BFS completes, we traverse the `topNode` map and add each node's data to the `ans` vector. The map automatically sorts the keys (HDs), ensuring the nodes are added in the correct order.

4. **Return**:
    - Finally, we return the `ans` vector, which contains the top view of the binary tree.

### Code with Comments
```cpp
vector<int> topView(Node *root) {
    vector<int> ans;
    if (root == NULL) {
        return ans;
    }
    
    // Map to store the first node at each horizontal distance
    map<int, int> topNode;
    // Queue for BFS, storing nodes along with their horizontal distance
    queue<pair<Node*, int>> q;
    
    // Start with the root node at horizontal distance 0
    q.push(make_pair(root, 0));
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        pair<Node*, int> temp = q.front();
        q.pop();
        Node* frontNode = temp.first;
        int hd = temp.second;
        
        // If this horizontal distance is encountered for the first time
        if (topNode.find(hd) == topNode.end()) {
            topNode[hd] = frontNode->data;
        }
        
        // Push left child with horizontal distance hd-1
        if (frontNode->left) {
            q.push(make_pair(frontNode->left, hd - 1));
        }
        // Push right child with horizontal distance hd+1
        if (frontNode->right) {
            q.push(make_pair(frontNode->right, hd + 1));
        }
    }
    
    // Collecting the top view nodes from the map
    for (auto i : topNode) {
        ans.push_back(i.second);
    }
    return ans;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The BFS traversal visits each node exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity for visiting all nodes is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Inserting into the map and checking if a key exists both have a time complexity of \(O(\log N)\). However, since each node is processed exactly once, this operation contributes \(O(N \log N)\) to the overall time complexity.
- Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\).

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is dominated by the space required for the queue and the map.
- The queue can hold at most \(O(N)\) nodes in the worst case (a complete binary tree).
- The map can hold at most \(O(N)\) entries in the worst case (every node has a unique horizontal distance).
- Therefore, the overall space complexity is \(O(N)\).

### Dry Run Example

Consider the following binary tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

- Initial state:
  - `q = [(1, 0)]`
  - `topNode = {}`

- Step 1: Process node 1:
  - `q = []`
  - `topNode = {0: 1}`
  - Push left child (2, -1) and right child (3, 1)

- Step 2: Process node 2:
  - `q = [(3, 1)]`
  - `topNode = {0: 1, -1: 2}`
  - Push left child (4, -2) and right child (5, 0)

- Step 3: Process node 3:
  - `q = [(4, -2), (5, 0)]`
  - `topNode = {0: 1, -1: 2, 1: 3}`
  - Push left child (6, 0) and right child (7, 2)

- Step 4: Process node 4:
  - `q = [(5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 2)]`
  - `topNode = {0: 1, -1: 2, 1: 3, -2: 4}`
  - No children to push

- Step 5: Process node 5:
  - `q = [(6, 0), (7, 2)]`
  - `topNode remains unchanged` (0 is already in the map)
  - No children to push

- Step 6: Process node 6:
  - `q = [(7, 2)]`
  - `topNode remains unchanged` (0 is already in the map)
  - No children to push

- Step 7: Process node 7:
  - `q = []`
  - `topNode = {0: 1, -1: 2, 1: 3, -2: 4, 2: 7}`
  - No children to push

- Final `topNode` map:
  - `{-2: 4, -1: 2, 0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 7}`
  
- Result vector `ans`:
  - `[4, 2, 1, 3, 7]`

Thus, the top view of the tree is `[4, 2, 1, 3, 7]`.
