### Explanation

The problem is to determine the minimum volume of the gas tank required for a car to travel from the starting point `0` to a destination point `x` and back to `0`, given that the car can refuel only at specified gas stations.

#### Approach:

1. **Read Inputs**: For each test case, read the number of gas stations `n` and the destination point `x`. Read the positions of the gas stations.

2. **Calculate Maximum Distances**:
   - **Sort Points**: Add the starting point `0` and the destination point `x` to the list of gas stations, then sort the points.
   - **Find Maximum Distance**:
     - Compute the maximum distance between consecutive points (gas stations including `0` and `x`).
     - Calculate distances from the starting point `0` to the first gas station and from the last gas station to the destination point `x`.
     - The maximum of these distances gives the required minimum tank capacity.

3. **Output Result**: Print the maximum distance for each test case.

### Time Complexity

- **Reading Input**: \(O(n)\) for each test case.
- **Sorting**: Sorting `n+2` points (including the start and end) takes \(O((n+2) \log (n+2))\).
- **Finding Maximum Distance**: Iterating through `n+1` distances takes \(O(n)\).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\) per test case.
- Given `t` test cases, the total complexity is \(O(t \times n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity

- **Space for Gas Stations**: \(O(n)\) for storing the positions.
- **Additional Space**: For sorting and calculating distances, additional space is \(O(1)\).
- **Overall Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) per test case.

### Dry Run

For the example:
```
1
100 102
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - Number of test cases: `t = 1`
   - For the test case: `n = 100`, `x = 102`
   - Gas station positions: `[1, 2, ..., 100]`

2. **Processing**:
   - **Add Start and End Points**: `a = [1, 2, ..., 100, 102]`
   - **Sort Points**: Already sorted.
   - **Calculate Distances**:
     - Maximum distance between consecutive stations: `1`
     - Distance from last station to endpoint: `2 * (102 - 100) = 4`
     - Distance from start to first station: `1`
   - **Maximum Distance**: `max(1, 4, 1) = 4`

3. **Output**: The minimum gas tank capacity required is `4` liters.

### Conclusion

- The provided code calculates the minimum gas tank capacity by determining the maximum distance required to be covered without refueling, considering all gas stations, the start, and the end point.
- The time and space complexities are manageable within the problem constraints.
