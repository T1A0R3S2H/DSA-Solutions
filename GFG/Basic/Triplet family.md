### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    bool findTriplet(vector<int> &arr){
        int n=arr.size();
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        for (int k=n-1; k>=2; k--){
            int i=0, j=k-1;
            while (i<j){
                int sum=arr[i]+arr[j];
                if (sum==arr[k]) return true;
                else if (sum<arr[k]) i++;
                else j--;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: First, the array is sorted to leverage the two-pointer approach.
2. **Iterate for Potential Triplets**: We iterate from the end of the array (`k` as the largest element) to find two other elements `i` and `j` such that `arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[k]`.
3. **Two-pointer Search**: For each `k`, two pointers `i` and `j` are used to find if there exists a pair `(arr[i], arr[j])` that adds up to `arr[k]`.
   - If `arr[i] + arr[j] == arr[k]`, return `true`.
   - If `arr[i] + arr[j] < arr[k]`, move `i` to the right to increase the sum.
   - If `arr[i] + arr[j] > arr[k]`, move `j` to the left to decrease the sum.
4. **Result**: If no such triplet is found after all iterations, return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The two-pointer search for each potential third element (`k`) takes \(O(n)\), and this is done for each element, so the complexity is \(O(n^2)\) in total.

### Space Complexity:
- \(O(1)\), as only a constant amount of extra space is used.

### Dry Run:

#### Example 1
**Input**: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

1. **Initial Steps**:
   - **Sort the Array**: After sorting, `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - **Array Size**: `n = 5`.

2. **Iteration with `k` as the largest element in triplets (start from `k = n - 1`)**:
   - **First Loop (k = 4, arr[k] = 5)**:
     - **Initialize Pointers**: `i = 0` and `j = 3`.
     - **Two-pointer Check**:
       - Calculate `sum = arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[0] + arr[3] = 1 + 4 = 5`.
       - Check if `sum == arr[k]` (i.e., `5 == 5`). This condition is true.
       - **Match Found**: The pair `(1, 4)` adds up to `5`, so the function returns `true`.

Since a valid triplet has been found, the function exits early without further iterations. 

**Output**: `true`

---

#### Example 2
**Input**: `arr = [5, 3, 4]`

1. **Initial Steps**:
   - **Sort the Array**: After sorting, `arr = [3, 4, 5]`.
   - **Array Size**: `n = 3`.

2. **Iteration with `k` as the largest element in triplets**:
   - **First Loop (k = 2, arr[k] = 5)**:
     - **Initialize Pointers**: `i = 0` and `j = 1`.
     - **Two-pointer Check**:
       - Calculate `sum = arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[0] + arr[1] = 3 + 4 = 7`.
       - Check if `sum == arr[k]` (i.e., `7 == 5`). This condition is false.
       - Since `sum > arr[k]`, decrement `j` by 1 (`j = 0`).
     - Now `i >= j`, so exit this two-pointer loop.

3. **Result**:
   - Since no valid triplet is found after all iterations, the function returns `false`.

**Output**: `false`

--- 

#### Example 3 (No Early Match Found)
**Input**: `arr = [10, 4, 6, 8, 2]`

1. **Initial Steps**:
   - **Sort the Array**: After sorting, `arr = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`.
   - **Array Size**: `n = 5`.

2. **Iteration with `k` as the largest element in triplets**:
   - **First Loop (k = 4, arr[k] = 10)**:
     - **Initialize Pointers**: `i = 0` and `j = 3`.
     - **Two-pointer Check**:
       - Calculate `sum = arr[i] + arr[j] = arr[0] + arr[3] = 2 + 8 = 10`.
       - Check if `sum == arr[k]` (i.e., `10 == 10`). This condition is true.
       - **Match Found**: The pair `(2, 8)` adds up to `10`, so the function returns `true`.

**Output**: `true`

--- 

In each example, the two-pointer approach efficiently checks pairs by moving `i` or `j` based on the current `sum` relative to `arr[k]`, leading to an early match where possible.
