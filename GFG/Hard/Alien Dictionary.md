### Explanation

The problem at hand is about determining the order of characters in an alien language given a sorted dictionary of `N` words and `K` distinct characters. This problem can be seen as a **topological sorting** problem on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where characters are treated as nodes, and an edge from node `u` to node `v` means that character `u` comes before character `v` in the alien language.

Here is a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - We build a directed graph where each character of the alien alphabet is a node.
   - By comparing adjacent words in the dictionary, we can find the first pair of characters that differ and establish an edge from the earlier character to the later character, indicating the order.

2. **Topological Sorting:**
   - Once the graph is constructed, we apply **topological sorting** to determine the correct order of the characters. Since the graph is a DAG (as no cycles are expected in a valid dictionary order), topological sorting is applicable.
   - We use Depth First Search (DFS) to perform the topological sort. The characters are pushed onto a stack when all their dependencies have been processed.

3. **Output the Order:**
   - After performing the topological sort, we pop the characters from the stack to get the desired order.

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** We need to compare pairs of adjacent words and then compare their characters until we find the first mismatch. This takes **O(N \* |s|)** time, where **N** is the number of words and **|s|** is the average length of the words.
- **Topological Sorting:** We perform DFS on the graph, which takes **O(K + E)** time, where **K** is the number of vertices (characters) and **E** is the number of edges.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N \* |s| + K)**.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is dominated by the adjacency list representing the graph, which takes **O(K + E)** space, where **K** is the number of characters (vertices) and **E** is the number of edges between them. Additionally, we use **O(K)** space for storing the visited array and the stack used in DFS.
  
Therefore, the overall space complexity is **O(K + E)**.

### Dry Run

Let's take the first example:

Input: `n = 5, k = 4, dict = {"baa", "abcd", "abca", "cab", "cad"}`

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Compare "baa" and "abcd": 'b' ≠ 'a', so add edge `b → a`.
   - Compare "abcd" and "abca": 'd' ≠ 'a', so add edge `d → a`.
   - Compare "abca" and "cab": 'a' ≠ 'c', so add edge `a → c`.
   - Compare "cab" and "cad": 'b' ≠ 'd', so add edge `b → d`.

2. **Adjacency List:**
   ```
   b → a, d
   d → a
   a → c
   ```

3. **Topological Sorting:**
   - Perform DFS starting from 'b', explore its adjacent nodes ('a' and 'd').
   - After processing all nodes, the stack contains the characters in reverse topological order.
   - Stack: ['b', 'd', 'a', 'c']

4. **Output:**
   - Pop the stack to get the order: **"bdac"**.

The order of characters is "bdac", which is one valid solution for this problem.
