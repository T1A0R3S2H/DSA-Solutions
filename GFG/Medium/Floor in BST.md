### Code
```cpp
class Solution{

public:
    int floor(Node* root, int x) {
        int floorValue=-1;
        while (root) {
            if (root->data==x) return root->data; // Found the exact value, return it as floor
            
            else if (root->data<x) {
                floorValue=root->data; // Update floorValue, go to right subtree.
                root=root->right;
            } 
            
            else root=root->left; // Go to left subtree to find a smaller value.
        }
        return floorValue;
}
};
```
### Explanation:
The goal of the problem is to find the greatest value node in a Binary Search Tree (BST) that is smaller than or equal to a given value `x`. If such a node does not exist (i.e., `x` is smaller than the smallest node in the BST), we return `-1`.

To achieve this, we use the BST property where:
- All values in the left subtree of a node are smaller than the node's value.
- All values in the right subtree of a node are greater than the node's value.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. We initialize `floorValue` to `-1`, which will store the potential floor value.
2. Starting from the root node, we traverse the BST:
   - If the current node's value is equal to `x`, we have found the floor, so we return it immediately.
   - If the current node's value is less than `x`, it could be a potential floor value. We update `floorValue` to the current node's value and move to the right child to see if there's a closer value.
   - If the current node's value is greater than `x`, we move to the left child, as any valid floor value must be in the left subtree.
3. The loop continues until all possible nodes are checked. If no exact match is found, the function returns the value stored in `floorValue`.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- The time complexity is \( O(\text{height of the tree}) \). In the worst-case scenario (for a skewed tree), this can be \( O(n) \), where `n` is the number of nodes. For a balanced BST, the height is \( O(\log n) \), making the time complexity \( O(\log n) \).

### Space Complexity Analysis:
- The space complexity is \( O(1) \) because the algorithm uses only a few extra variables, regardless of the size of the input tree. It does not use any auxiliary data structures that grow with the input size.

### Dry Run:

Let's do a dry run of the algorithm with the provided example:

**Example Tree:**

```
       2
        \
        81
       /   \
     42    87
       \     \
       66    90
      /
    45
```

**Input:** `x = 87`

1. Initialize `floorValue = -1`.
2. Start at the root node: `2`.
   - `2 < 87` → Update `floorValue = 2`. Move to the right child.
3. Current node: `81`.
   - `81 < 87` → Update `floorValue = 81`. Move to the right child.
4. Current node: `87`.
   - `87 == 87` → Exact match found. Return `87`.

**Output:** `87` (correct, as 87 is present in the tree).

**Second Example:**

```
      6
       \
        8
       / \
      7   9
```

**Input:** `x = 11`

1. Initialize `floorValue = -1`.
2. Start at the root node: `6`.
   - `6 < 11` → Update `floorValue = 6`. Move to the right child.
3. Current node: `8`.
   - `8 < 11` → Update `floorValue = 8`. Move to the right child.
4. Current node: `9`.
   - `9 < 11` → Update `floorValue = 9`. Move to the right child, which is `NULL`.

**Output:** `9` (correct, as 9 is the largest node less than 11).

This dry run demonstrates how the algorithm efficiently finds the floor value in a BST using its properties.
