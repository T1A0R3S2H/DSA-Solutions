### Code:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* connect(Node* root) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;

        // Initialize a queue for level order traversal
        queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);

        // Loop until the queue is empty
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            Node* prev = nullptr;

            // Process all nodes at the current level
            for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
                Node* current = q.front();
                q.pop();

                // Set the nextRight pointer of the previous node to the current node
                if (prev) {
                    prev->nextRight = current;
                }
                prev = current;

                // Push left and right children into the queue if they exist
                if (current->left) {
                    q.push(current->left);
                }
                if (current->right) {
                    q.push(current->right);
                }
            }

            // The last node in the current level should point to NULL
            prev->nextRight = nullptr;
        }

        return root;
    }
};
```

### Explanation:

1. **Level Order Traversal with Queue**: The algorithm uses a queue to perform a level order traversal of the binary tree. Each level is processed separately.

2. **Connection of `nextRight` Pointers**: As the nodes at each level are processed, the `nextRight` pointer of each node is set to point to the next node in the queue. If a node is the last in its level, its `nextRight` pointer is set to `nullptr`.

3. **Checking for Children**: Before pushing left and right children into the queue, the code checks if they exist, ensuring that null nodes are handled correctly.

### Time Complexity: 

- **O(N)**: Each node is visited once, making the algorithm's time complexity linear in terms of the number of nodes.

### Space Complexity: 

- **O(N)**: The queue can hold up to the maximum number of nodes at any level of the tree, which can be up to half of all nodes in a full binary tree.

This corrected version should handle cases where the binary tree is not perfect and include scenarios where some nodes do not have both children. The use of a queue ensures that nodes are connected correctly at each level.
