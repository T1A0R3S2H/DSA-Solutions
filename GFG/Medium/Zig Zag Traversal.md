### Detailed Explanation

The provided code is designed to perform a zigzag (or spiral) level order traversal of a binary tree. This traversal alternates between left-to-right and right-to-left at each level.

### Code Walkthrough

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> zigZagTraversal(Node* root) {
        if (root == NULL) return {};
        vector<int> res;
        queue<Node*> q;
        q.push(root);
        int flag = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            vector<int> temp;
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                Node* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                temp.push_back(node->data);
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }
            if (flag) reverse(temp.begin(), temp.end());
            res.insert(res.end(), temp.begin(), temp.end());
            flag = 1 - flag;
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the `root` is `NULL`, return an empty vector.

2. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - `res`: A vector to store the final zigzag order traversal.
   - `q`: A queue to help with the level order traversal. It starts by enqueuing the root node.
   - `flag`: An integer flag to track the current direction of traversal (0 for left-to-right, 1 for right-to-left).

3. **Level Order Traversal**:
   - Use a `while` loop to traverse the tree level by level until the queue is empty.
   - For each level, determine the number of nodes (`size`).
   - Use a `for` loop to process all nodes at the current level:
     - Dequeue a node, add its value to `temp`.
     - Enqueue its left and right children (if they exist).
   - If `flag` is set, reverse the `temp` vector.
   - Append the `temp` vector to `res`.
   - Toggle the `flag` to change the direction for the next level.

### Time Complexity

- **Queue Operations**: Each node is enqueued and dequeued exactly once.
- **Reversal Operation**: Each levelâ€™s nodes are reversed at most once per level.
  
  Let's assume the binary tree has `N` nodes and `H` levels.

- **Overall Complexity**: 
  - For each node, we perform constant-time operations (enqueue, dequeue, and add to `temp`).
  - Reversing a level takes `O(W)` time where `W` is the width of the level. The maximum width of a binary tree is `N` in the worst case.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(N)`.

### Space Complexity

- **Queue**: The queue can hold at most one level of the binary tree at a time. In the worst case, this can be `O(N/2)` nodes (for a complete binary tree), which simplifies to `O(N)`.
- **Temporary Vector (`temp`)**: This also holds one level of the tree, thus `O(N)` in the worst case.
- **Result Vector (`res`)**: This stores all nodes in the tree, so its space complexity is `O(N)`.

Overall, the space complexity is `O(N)`.

### Dry Run

Let's dry run the code with a sample binary tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \   \
4   5   6
```

1. **Initialization**:
   - `q = [1]`
   - `res = []`
   - `flag = 0`

2. **First Level**:
   - `size = 1`
   - `temp = []`
   - Dequeue `1`, `temp = [1]`
   - Enqueue `2`, `3`
   - `flag = 0` (left-to-right), no reversal
   - `res = [1]`
   - Toggle `flag = 1`

3. **Second Level**:
   - `size = 2`
   - `temp = []`
   - Dequeue `2`, `temp = [2]`, enqueue `4`, `5`
   - Dequeue `3`, `temp = [2, 3]`, enqueue `6`
   - `flag = 1` (right-to-left), reverse `temp = [3, 2]`
   - `res = [1, 3, 2]`
   - Toggle `flag = 0`

4. **Third Level**:
   - `size = 3`
   - `temp = []`
   - Dequeue `4`, `temp = [4]`
   - Dequeue `5`, `temp = [4, 5]`
   - Dequeue `6`, `temp = [4, 5, 6]`
   - `flag = 0` (left-to-right), no reversal
   - `res = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]`

5. **Completion**:
   - Queue is empty, traversal complete.
   - Return `res`.

The final output is `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the zigzag level order traversal of the given binary tree.
