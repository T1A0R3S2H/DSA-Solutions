### Explanation:

We are given a `start` value, an `end` value, and an array `arr` of size `n`. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps to reach `end` from `start` by multiplying `start` with any number in the array `arr` and taking the result modulo `100000` at each step. If it is not possible to reach `end`, we return `-1`.

### Approach:

This problem can be solved using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. BFS is useful here because it explores all possibilities level by level (i.e., it finds the shortest path in an unweighted scenario like this one).

#### Steps:
1. **State Representation**: The state is the current value (`u`) that we have obtained after some steps.
2. **Transition**: From the current state `u`, for each element in `arr[]`, the next state is calculated as `(u * arr[i]) % 100000`. Each of these transitions represents a step.
3. **Queue for BFS**: We use a queue to keep track of the current state and the number of steps taken to reach that state. Each queue entry is a pair `(current_state, steps_taken)`.
4. **Visited Array**: We maintain a `visited[]` array to avoid revisiting states, as revisiting will not reduce the number of steps (due to BFS ensuring the shortest path).
5. **End Condition**: If we reach the `end` value, we return the number of steps taken to reach it.

If BFS finishes without finding the `end`, we return `-1`.

### Code Walkthrough:

```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
    int minimumMultiplications(vector<int>& arr, int start, int end) {
        int mod = 100000; // We need to take mod with 100000 in each step
        int n = arr.size();
        
        // Step 1: Create a queue for BFS
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({start, 0});  // (start, 0) means we start with 'start' and 0 steps taken
        
        // Step 2: Create a visited array to keep track of visited states
        vector<bool> vis(mod, 0);  // false means not visited
        vis[start] = 1;  // mark start as visited
        
        // Step 3: BFS to explore the shortest path
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int steps = q.front().second; // Get the steps taken so far
            int u = q.front().first;      // Current state (value)
            q.pop();
            
            // If we've reached the end, return the number of steps
            if (u == end) return steps;
            
            // Traverse all possible new states by multiplying with each element in arr
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int newState = (u * arr[i]) % mod; // Get the new state
                
                // If the new state has not been visited
                if (!vis[newState]) {
                    q.push({newState, steps + 1}); // Push the new state and increment steps
                    vis[newState] = 1;  // Mark this state as visited
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If BFS completes and we haven't reached 'end', return -1
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of Code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We initialize the queue `q` and push the starting state `(start, 0)` which indicates the current value is `start` and `0` steps have been taken.
   - We create a `visited` array of size `mod` (100000) to track which states have already been visited.

2. **BFS Algorithm**:
   - In each iteration, we pop the front of the queue, which gives us the current value `u` and the steps taken to reach this value.
   - If `u == end`, we return the number of steps.
   - For each value in `arr`, we calculate the next state `newState = (u * arr[i]) % mod` and if this state hasn't been visited before, we push it into the queue with an incremented step count and mark it as visited.

3. **End Condition**:
   - If we reach the `end` during the BFS traversal, we return the number of steps.
   - If the BFS completes without finding `end`, we return `-1`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(100000 * n)`
   - We may visit each state (mod 100000, hence at most 100000 distinct states) once. For each state, we perform a transition for every element in the array `arr[]` (which takes `O(n)` time). Hence, the total time complexity is `O(100000 * n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: `O(100000)`
   - We maintain a `visited` array of size `100000` and a queue that can have at most `100000` elements in the worst case. Therefore, the space complexity is `O(100000)`.

### Dry Run:

#### Example 1:

**Input**:  
`arr[] = {2, 5, 7}`, `start = 3`, `end = 30`

1. Initial State: `(3, 0)`
2. Multiply by 2: `(3 * 2) % 100000 = 6` → Queue: `[(6, 1)]`
3. Multiply by 5: `(6 * 5) % 100000 = 30` → End reached, return 2 steps.

**Output**: 2

### Conclusion:
This BFS-based approach efficiently finds the minimum steps to reach the desired `end` value by exploring all possible paths systematically and avoiding redundant work through the use of the `visited[]` array.
