### Code:
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    // Helper function to count the number of nodes in the binary tree
    int countNodes(Node* root) {
        if (root==NULL) return 0;
        return 1+countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right);
    }
    
    // Helper function to check if the binary tree is a complete binary tree
    bool isCBT(Node* root, int i, int size) {
        if (root==NULL) return true;
        if (i>=size) return false;
        return isCBT(root->left, 2*i+1, size) && isCBT(root->right, 2*i+2, size);
    }
    
    // Helper function to check if the binary tree satisfies the max heap property
    bool isMaxHeap(Node* root) {
        if (root==NULL) return true;
        if (root->left==NULL && root->right==NULL) return true;
        if (root->right==NULL) return root->left->data <= root->data;
        
        else {
            bool left=root->left->data<=root->data;
            bool right=root->right->data<=root->data;
            return left && right && isMaxHeap(root->left) && isMaxHeap(root->right);
        }
    }
    
    bool isHeap(Node* root) {
        int size=countNodes(root);
        return isCBT(root, 0, size) && isMaxHeap(root);
    }

};
```
### Explanation

The task is to determine whether a given binary tree satisfies the max heap property. A binary tree is a max heap if it fulfills two conditions:
1. **Completeness**: The tree is a complete binary tree.
2. **Max Heap Property**: Every node’s value is greater than or equal to its children's values.

The solution involves:
1. **Counting Nodes**: A helper function counts the total number of nodes in the binary tree.
2. **Checking Completeness**: Another helper function verifies if the tree is a complete binary tree by recursively checking that all nodes meet the completeness criteria.
3. **Checking Max Heap Property**: A third helper function ensures that every node satisfies the max heap property by comparing node values to their children's values.

### Time Complexity

- **`countNodes`**: This function visits each node exactly once. Thus, its time complexity is \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **`isCBT`**: This function also visits each node exactly once, so its time complexity is \( O(N) \).
- **`isMaxHeap`**: Similarly, this function visits each node exactly once. Its time complexity is \( O(N) \).

Overall, the `isHeap` function combines these helper functions, leading to a total time complexity of \( O(N) \).

### Space Complexity

- **Recursive Call Stack**: Each recursive call adds a layer to the call stack. In the worst case, the depth of the call stack is \( O(h) \), where \( h \) is the height of the tree. For a balanced tree, \( h = O(\log N) \), but for a skewed tree, \( h = O(N) \).
- **Auxiliary Space**: The space used by the additional variables is constant, \( O(1) \).

Thus, the space complexity is \( O(N) \) in the worst case due to the recursive stack space.

### Dry Run

Consider the following binary tree for dry run:

```
       10
     /    \
    20     30
   /  \
  40   60
```

1. **Count Nodes**: The tree has 6 nodes. `countNodes` will return 6.

2. **Check Completeness**:
   - Start at index 0. Node 10 is present and has children at indices 1 and 2.
   - Move to index 1. Node 20 is present and has children at indices 3 and 4.
   - Move to index 2. Node 30 has no children (correctly handles NULL).
   - Move to index 3. Node 40 is a leaf node, and indices 7 and 8 are beyond the size, so completeness holds.
   - Move to index 4. Node 60 is a leaf node, and indices 9 and 10 are beyond the size, so completeness holds.

   `isCBT` will return true.

3. **Check Max Heap Property**:
   - Node 10 is the root. Check its children (20 and 30). 10 ≥ 20 and 10 ≥ 30, so continue.
   - Node 20 has children (40 and 60). 20 ≥ 40 and 20 ≥ 60, so continue.
   - Node 30 has no children.
   - Node 40 and 60 are leaf nodes and thus satisfy the property.

   `isMaxHeap` will return true.

4. **Final Check**: Both completeness and max heap property checks return true, so `isHeap` will return true.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N) \)
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(N) \) in the worst case due to recursive stack space.
- **Dry Run**: Confirms that the solution correctly identifies the tree as a max heap.

This approach effectively and efficiently determines whether a binary tree satisfies the max heap property.
