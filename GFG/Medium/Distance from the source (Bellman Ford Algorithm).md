The Bellman-Ford algorithm is a shortest path algorithm for graphs that can handle negative weights. It works by iteratively relaxing edges and checking for negative-weight cycles.
### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - The `dist` vector is initialized to hold distances from the source vertex `S` to all other vertices, with initial values set to a large number (`1e8`) to represent infinity. The distance to the source itself is set to `0`.

2. **Relaxation (Main Loop):**
   - The algorithm iterates `V-1` times over all edges, attempting to "relax" each edge. Relaxing an edge means checking if a shorter path to the destination vertex of the edge can be found via the source vertex of the edge. If a shorter path is found, the distance to the destination vertex is updated.

3. **Negative Cycle Check:**
   - After the `V-1` iterations, the algorithm performs one more pass over all edges. If it finds that any distance can still be updated (i.e., a shorter path is found), this implies the presence of a negative weight cycle. In such a case, the algorithm returns `{-1}`.

4. **Return Distances:**
   - If no negative cycles are detected, the algorithm returns the `dist` vector, which now contains the shortest distances from the source vertex `S` to all other vertices.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- The algorithm runs the relaxation step `V-1` times, where each relaxation involves iterating over all edges.
- Let `E` be the number of edges and `V` be the number of vertices.
- **Time Complexity:** `O(V * E)` because each of the `V-1` iterations requires examining all `E` edges.

### Space Complexity Analysis

- The algorithm uses a `dist` vector to store the shortest distances for each of the `V` vertices.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices.

### Dry Run

Let's dry run the algorithm on a sample input to better understand its functionality.

**Graph Representation:**  
- Let the graph have `V = 4` vertices numbered from 0 to 3.  
- Let the edges be represented as `edges = {{0, 1, 1}, {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 2}, {3, 1, -6}}`.  
  Here, each edge is represented as `{u, v, w}` where `u` is the source vertex, `v` is the destination vertex, and `w` is the weight of the edge.

**Source Vertex:** `S = 0`.

**Initial Setup:**  
- `dist = [0, 1e8, 1e8, 1e8]` (since we initialize all distances to a large value and `dist[S] = 0`).

#### Iteration 1:

1. **Edge (0, 1, 1):**  
   - `dist[1] > dist[0] + 1` ⟹ `1e8 > 0 + 1`, so update `dist[1] = 1`.
   - `dist = [0, 1, 1e8, 1e8]`.

2. **Edge (1, 2, 3):**  
   - `dist[2] > dist[1] + 3` ⟹ `1e8 > 1 + 3`, so update `dist[2] = 4`.
   - `dist = [0, 1, 4, 1e8]`.

3. **Edge (2, 3, 2):**  
   - `dist[3] > dist[2] + 2` ⟹ `1e8 > 4 + 2`, so update `dist[3] = 6`.
   - `dist = [0, 1, 4, 6]`.

4. **Edge (3, 1, -6):**  
   - `dist[1] > dist[3] + (-6)` ⟹ `1 > 6 - 6`, so update `dist[1] = 0`.
   - `dist = [0, 0, 4, 6]`.

#### Iteration 2:

1. **Edge (0, 1, 1):**  
   - No update needed as `dist[1]` is already `0`.

2. **Edge (1, 2, 3):**  
   - `dist[2] > dist[1] + 3` ⟹ `4 > 0 + 3`, so update `dist[2] = 3`.
   - `dist = [0, 0, 3, 6]`.

3. **Edge (2, 3, 2):**  
   - `dist[3] > dist[2] + 2` ⟹ `6 > 3 + 2`, so update `dist[3] = 5`.
   - `dist = [0, 0, 3, 5]`.

4. **Edge (3, 1, -6):**  
   - `dist[1] > dist[3] + (-6)` ⟹ `0 > 5 - 6`, so update `dist[1] = -1`.
   - `dist = [0, -1, 3, 5]`.

#### Iteration 3:

1. **Edge (0, 1, 1):**  
   - No update needed as `dist[1]` is already `-1`.

2. **Edge (1, 2, 3):**  
   - `dist[2] > dist[1] + 3` ⟹ `3 > -1 + 3`, so update `dist[2] = 2`.
   - `dist = [0, -1, 2, 5]`.

3. **Edge (2, 3, 2):**  
   - `dist[3] > dist[2] + 2` ⟹ `5 > 2 + 2`, so update `dist[3] = 4`.
   - `dist = [0, -1, 2, 4]`.

4. **Edge (3, 1, -6):**  
   - `dist[1] > dist[3] + (-6)` ⟹ `-1 > 4 - 6`, so update `dist[1] = -2`.
   - `dist = [0, -2, 2, 4]`.

#### Check for Negative Cycles:

- Now, iterate over each edge again to check if any distance can be further relaxed.

1. **Edge (0, 1, 1):**  
   - No update needed as `dist[1]` is already `-2`.

2. **Edge (1, 2, 3):**  
   - `dist[2] > dist[1] + 3` ⟹ `2 > -2 + 3`, no update needed.

3. **Edge (2, 3, 2):**  
   - `dist[3] > dist[2] + 2` ⟹ `4 > 2 + 2`, no update needed.

4. **Edge (3, 1, -6):**  
   - `dist[1] > dist[3] + (-6)` ⟹ `-2 > 4 - 6`, which is true. This indicates a negative cycle.

Since a negative cycle is detected, the algorithm returns `{-1}`.

### Conclusion

This dry run shows how the Bellman-Ford algorithm works by relaxing edges iteratively and checking for negative weight cycles. In this example, a negative cycle is present, which is correctly detected by the algorithm, leading to an early termination and returning `{-1}`.
