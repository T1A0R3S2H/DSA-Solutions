                    break; 
                }

    void inorder(Node* root, vector<int> &vec){

    }
};

### Explanation:

The given code is a C++ solution for finding the predecessor (`pre`) and successor (`suc`) of a given key in a Binary Search Tree (BST). 

**Key Concepts:**
- **Predecessor:** The predecessor of a node in a BST is the node with the largest value that is smaller than the given node's value.
- **Successor:** The successor of a node in a BST is the node with the smallest value that is larger than the given node's value.

**Functionality:**
1. The `findPreSuc` function performs the task of finding the predecessor and successor.
2. The `inorder` function is a helper function that performs an in-order traversal of the BST, storing the node values in a vector `vec`.
3. After collecting the node values in `vec`, the function iterates through the vector to find the predecessor (the last value smaller than the key) and successor (the first value larger than the key).

### Time Complexity:
- **Inorder Traversal:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the BST.
- **Finding Predecessor and Successor:** O(n), since in the worst case, you might need to check every element in `vec`.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n) + O(n) = O(2n) = O(n)

### Space Complexity:
- **Inorder Traversal:** O(n) to store the node values in the vector `vec`.
- **Additional Pointers (pre, suc):** O(1)
- **Overall Space Complexity:** O(n) (due to the vector `vec`)

### Dry Run:

Consider the following BST:

```
        20
       /  \
     10    30
     / \   / \
    5  15 25  35
```

Let's find the predecessor and successor of `key = 25`.

**Step 1: Inorder Traversal**
- The `inorder` function will traverse the BST in the following order: [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35]. 
- This list will be stored in `vec`.

**Step 2: Find Predecessor and Successor**
- The loop checks each value in `vec`:
    - If the value is less than 25, update `pre` (predecessor).
    - If the value is greater than 25, update `suc` (successor) and break the loop.
  
    **Iterations:**
    - `i=0`: 5 (less than 25) → pre = 5
    - `i=1`: 10 (less than 25) → pre = 10
    - `i=2`: 15 (less than 25) → pre = 15
    - `i=3`: 20 (less than 25) → pre = 20
    - `i=4`: 25 (equal to 25) → continue
    - `i=5`: 30 (greater than 25) → suc = 30, break
    
**Final Values:**
- `pre = 20`
- `suc = 30`

So, the predecessor of `25` is `20` and the successor is `30`.

### Note:
This approach has some inefficiencies:
- It uses extra space by storing all the node values in a vector.
- It involves iterating over the vector, which can be avoided by directly finding the predecessor and successor during the traversal itself.

The code can be optimized by avoiding the use of an auxiliary vector and by modifying the `findPreSuc` function to directly update `pre` and `suc` during the in-order traversal, making it more efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
