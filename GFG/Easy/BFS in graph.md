### Explanation

The function `bfsOfGraph` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) on an undirected graph represented by an adjacency list. The BFS traversal starts from the first node (`0`) and visits all nodes in a level-order manner. Here is a breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `vector<int> ans`: This vector stores the result of the BFS traversal, i.e., the order in which nodes are visited.
   - `vector<int> visited(V, 0)`: This vector keeps track of whether a node has been visited (`1` for visited, `0` for not visited). It is initialized to `0` for all nodes.
   - `queue<int> q`: A queue is used to facilitate the BFS traversal. It stores nodes to be processed.

2. **Starting BFS**:
   - The BFS traversal starts by pushing the starting node `0` into the queue (`q.push(0);`) and marking it as visited (`visited[0] = 1;`).

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The loop `while (!q.empty())` runs as long as there are nodes to be processed in the queue.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `int front = q.front(); q.pop();`: The node at the front of the queue is taken out, and this node is processed.
     - `ans.push_back(front);`: The current node is added to the result vector.
     - The `for` loop iterates over all adjacent nodes of the current node (`front`). If an adjacent node has not been visited, it is pushed into the queue and marked as visited.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns the `ans` vector, which contains the BFS traversal order of the graph.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: `O(V)` to initialize the `visited` array.
- **BFS Traversal**: Each node is added to the queue once and processed once. Each edge is checked once. Therefore:
  - Visiting all vertices takes `O(V)` time.
  - Checking all edges takes `O(E)` time, where `E` is the number of edges.
  
Overall time complexity is `O(V + E)`.

### Space Complexity

- `O(V)` for the `visited` array.
- `O(V)` for the queue, in the worst case, where all nodes are in the queue.
- `O(V)` for the `ans` vector.

Overall space complexity is `O(V)`.

### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run on a simple example:

#### Example Graph:
```
0 - 1 - 2
|   |
3 - 4
```

- Adjacency list representation:
  ```
  0 -> [1, 3]
  1 -> [0, 2, 4]
  2 -> [1]
  3 -> [0, 4]
  4 -> [1, 3]
  ```

- Number of vertices `V = 5`

**Step-by-step Dry Run**:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans = []`
   - `visited = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `queue = []`

2. **Start BFS**:
   - Push node `0` to the queue and mark it visited.
   - `queue = [0]`, `visited = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

3. **First Iteration**:
   - `front = 0`, `queue = []`
   - `ans = [0]`
   - Adjacent nodes of `0` are `1` and `3`.
   - Push `1` and `3` to the queue and mark them visited.
   - `queue = [1, 3]`, `visited = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]`

4. **Second Iteration**:
   - `front = 1`, `queue = [3]`
   - `ans = [0, 1]`
   - Adjacent nodes of `1` are `0`, `2`, and `4`. `0` is already visited.
   - Push `2` and `4` to the queue and mark them visited.
   - `queue = [3, 2, 4]`, `visited = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`

5. **Third Iteration**:
   - `front = 3`, `queue = [2, 4]`
   - `ans = [0, 1, 3]`
   - Adjacent nodes of `3` are `0` and `4`. Both are already visited.
   - `queue = [2, 4]`

6. **Fourth Iteration**:
   - `front = 2`, `queue = [4]`
   - `ans = [0, 1, 3, 2]`
   - Adjacent node of `2` is `1`, which is already visited.
   - `queue = [4]`

7. **Fifth Iteration**:
   - `front = 4`, `queue = []`
   - `ans = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]`
   - Adjacent nodes of `4` are `1` and `3`. Both are already visited.
   - `queue = []`

8. **End BFS**:
   - `queue` is empty, exit loop.
   - Return `ans = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]`

This order represents the BFS traversal of the graph starting from node `0`.

### Summary

- The `while (!q.empty())` loop ensures that BFS correctly processes nodes in level order.
- The `for (int i = 0; i < V; i++)` loop would not maintain this behavior, leading to incorrect results.
- The time complexity of the BFS implementation is `O(V + E)`, and space complexity is `O(V)`.
