### Explanation:

Here's how you can modify the `reverseLevelOrder` function to use a `vector<int>` to collect nodes in level order and then reverse it at the end:

```cpp
vector<int> reverseLevelOrder(Node* root) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return result;
    }

    queue<Node*> q;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        result.push_back(node->data);

        // Push right child first, then left child to ensure left is processed first
        if (node->right) {
            q.push(node->right);
        }
        if (node->left) {
            q.push(node->left);
        }
    }

    // Reverse the result vector to get the reverse level order
    reverse(result.begin(), result.end());

    return result;
}
```

### Explanation of the Modified Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize a `vector<int> result` to store the traversal order.
   - A `queue<Node*> q` is used to perform the level order traversal (BFS).

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We start by pushing the root node into the queue.
   - We process nodes level by level. For each node, we pop it from the queue and add its value to the `result` vector.
   - We then enqueue the right child first and then the left child. This order ensures that when we reverse the `result` vector, the left child will come before the right child, giving the correct reverse level order traversal.

3. **Reversing the Result:**
   - After collecting all nodes in level order, we reverse the `result` vector to get the nodes in reverse level order.

### Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the modified function is still **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Each node is processed exactly once during the BFS traversal.
- Pushing and popping each node in and out of the queue takes O(1) time.
- The final reversal of the `result` vector takes O(n) time.
- Thus, the total time complexity remains O(n).

### Space Complexity Analysis

The space complexity of the modified function is also **O(n)**.

- The queue can hold up to `n` nodes in the worst case (when all nodes are on the same level).
- The `result` vector will eventually hold all `n` node values.
- No additional stack is used; hence the space used is O(n).

### Dry Run

Let's do a dry run with the same simple binary tree as before:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

**Steps of Execution:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result = []`
   - `q = [1]`

2. **First Iteration (Root Level):**
   - Pop 1 from `q`, add 1 to `result`: `result = [1]`.
   - Push 3 (right child), then 2 (left child) to `q`: `q = [3, 2]`.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - Pop 3 from `q`, add 3 to `result`: `result = [1, 3]`.
   - Push 7 (right child), then 6 (left child) to `q`: `q = [2, 7, 6]`.
   - Pop 2 from `q`, add 2 to `result`: `result = [1, 3, 2]`.
   - Push 5 (right child), then 4 (left child) to `q`: `q = [7, 6, 5, 4]`.

4. **Third Iteration (Leaf Level):**
   - Pop 7 from `q`, add 7 to `result`: `result = [1, 3, 2, 7]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.
   - Pop 6 from `q`, add 6 to `result`: `result = [1, 3, 2, 7, 6]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.
   - Pop 5 from `q`, add 5 to `result`: `result = [1, 3, 2, 7, 6, 5]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.
   - Pop 4 from `q`, add 4 to `result`: `result = [1, 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.

5. **Reversing the Result:**
   - Reverse `result`: `result = [4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 1]`.

The output `[4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 1]` matches the expected reverse level order traversal of the given tree.

### Conclusion

Using a vector and reversing it at the end is a clean and straightforward way to achieve reverse level order traversal. This method maintains the same time and space complexity as the previous approach with the stack but avoids the need for an explicit stack, simplifying the code.
