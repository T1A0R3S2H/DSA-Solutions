### Explanation of the Code

The code snippet provided is for a function `reverseLevelOrder` that performs a reverse level order traversal of a binary tree and returns a vector of integers representing the traversal result.

Here's the code again for reference:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <stack>

using namespace std;

// Definition of Node
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* left;
    Node* right;
    Node(int val) : data(val), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

vector<int> reverseLevelOrder(Node* root) {
    vector<int> result;
    if (root == nullptr) {
        return result;
    }

    queue<Node*> q;
    stack<int> s;
    q.push(root);

    while (!q.empty()) {
        Node* node = q.front();
        q.pop();
        s.push(node->data);

        // Push right child first, then left child
        if (node->right) {
            q.push(node->right);
        }
        if (node->left) {
            q.push(node->left);
        }
    }

    // Transfer the stack to the result vector
    while (!s.empty()) {
        result.push_back(s.top());
        s.pop();
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Explanation of how the code works:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize a `vector<int> result` to store the final traversal order.
   - A `queue<Node*> q` is used for level order traversal (BFS).
   - A `stack<int> s` is used to reverse the order of nodes.

2. **Edge Case:**
   - If the `root` is `nullptr`, the function returns an empty `result` vector.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - We start by pushing the root node into the queue.
   - We process nodes level by level. For each node, we pop it from the queue, push its value onto the stack, and then enqueue its right child followed by its left child.
   - Pushing the right child first ensures that when we later pop from the stack, the left child comes before the right child.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - After the BFS is complete, the stack will have the nodes in reverse level order.
   - We pop elements from the stack and push them into the `result` vector, effectively reversing the order of the traversal.

### Time Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the function is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

- Each node is processed exactly once during the BFS traversal.
- Pushing and popping each node in and out of the queue and stack takes O(1) time.
- Thus, the total time complexity is proportional to the number of nodes, O(n).

### Space Complexity Analysis

The space complexity of the function is also **O(n)**.

- The queue can hold up to `n` nodes in the worst case (when all nodes are on the same level).
- The stack also stores up to `n` node values.
- The result vector will eventually hold all `n` node values.
- Hence, the overall space complexity is O(n).

### Dry Run

Let's do a dry run with a simple binary tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

**Steps of Execution:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - `result = []`
   - `q = [1]`
   - `s = []`

2. **First Iteration (Root Level):**
   - Pop 1 from `q`, push 1 to `s`: `s = [1]`.
   - Push 3 (right child), then 2 (left child) to `q`: `q = [3, 2]`.

3. **Second Iteration:**
   - Pop 3 from `q`, push 3 to `s`: `s = [1, 3]`.
   - Push 7 (right child), then 6 (left child) to `q`: `q = [2, 7, 6]`.
   - Pop 2 from `q`, push 2 to `s`: `s = [1, 3, 2]`.
   - Push 5 (right child), then 4 (left child) to `q`: `q = [7, 6, 5, 4]`.

4. **Third Iteration (Leaf Level):**
   - Pop 7 from `q`, push 7 to `s`: `s = [1, 3, 2, 7]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.
   - Pop 6 from `q`, push 6 to `s`: `s = [1, 3, 2, 7, 6]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.
   - Pop 5 from `q`, push 5 to `s`: `s = [1, 3, 2, 7, 6, 5]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.
   - Pop 4 from `q`, push 4 to `s`: `s = [1, 3, 2, 7, 6, 5, 4]`.
   - No children to add to `q`.

5. **Constructing the Result:**
   - `result = [4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 1]` (by popping from `s`).

This dry run demonstrates how the nodes are processed level by level and how the stack reverses the order to achieve the reverse level order traversal. The final output is `[4, 5, 6, 7, 2, 3, 1]`, which matches the expected reverse level order traversal of the given tree.
