### Code:
```cpp
class Solution{
    public:
    vector<int> mergeHeaps(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b, int n, int m) {
        vector<int> c;
        c.insert(c.end(), a.begin(), a.end());
        c.insert(c.end(), b.begin(), b.end());

        // for a binary tree, the parent ends at n/2 - 1
        for (int i=(c.size()/2)-1; i>=0; --i) {
            heapify(c, c.size(), i);
        }
        return c;
    }
    
    void heapify(vector<int>& nums, int n, int i) {
        int largest=i;
        int left=2*i+1;
        int right=2*i+2;
        if (left<n && nums[left]>nums[largest]) {
            largest=left;
        }
        if (right<n && nums[right]>nums[largest]) {
            largest=right;
        }
        if (largest!=i) {
            swap(nums[i], nums[largest]);
            heapify(nums, n, largest);
        }
    
```
### Explanation

The `mergeHeaps` function combines two binary max heaps into a single max heap. Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. **Combine Heaps:**
   - The function starts by merging two max heaps, `a` and `b`, into a single vector `c`.

2. **Build Max Heap:**
   - It then converts the combined vector `c` into a max heap by applying the `heapify` function. The `heapify` process is performed starting from the last non-leaf node up to the root.

3. **Heapify Process:**
   - `heapify` ensures that the subtree rooted at index `i` satisfies the max heap property by adjusting the tree recursively.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `mergeHeaps` function is \(O((n + m) \log(n + m))\), where `n` and `m` are the sizes of the two input heaps.

- **Combining Arrays:** This operation takes \(O(n + m)\) time.
- **Building the Heap:** The heap construction process (heapify) takes \(O((n + m) \log(n + m))\) time. The heapify operation runs in \(O(\log k)\) time for each node, where \(k\) is the number of nodes in the heap. Since the process is applied to each non-leaf node, the overall complexity is \(O((n + m) \log(n + m))\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the `mergeHeaps` function is \(O(n + m)\):

- **Combined Vector:** The combined vector `c` requires \(O(n + m)\) space to store the elements of the two heaps.
- **Auxiliary Space:** The `heapify` function uses constant space \(O(1)\) except for the recursive call stack, which is negligible compared to the space used by the combined vector.

### Dry Run

Let’s dry run the example given:

**Input:**

- `a = {10, 5, 6, 2}`
- `b = {12, 7, 9}`
- `n = 4` (size of `a`)
- `m = 3` (size of `b`)

**Steps:**

1. **Combine Arrays:**
   - Merge `a` and `b` to get `c = {10, 5, 6, 2, 12, 7, 9}`.

2. **Heapify Process:**
   - Start heapify from the last non-leaf node, which is at index `(c.size() / 2) - 1 = 2`.

   - **Heapify at Index 2:**
     - Node: 6
     - Left child: 9 (index 5)
     - Right child: None
     - Swap 6 with 9: `c = {10, 5, 9, 2, 12, 7, 6}`

   - **Heapify at Index 1:**
     - Node: 5
     - Left child: 2 (index 3)
     - Right child: 12 (index 4)
     - Swap 5 with 12: `c = {10, 12, 9, 2, 5, 7, 6}`
     - Heapify subtree rooted at index 4 (no changes needed).

   - **Heapify at Index 0:**
     - Node: 10
     - Left child: 12 (index 1)
     - Right child: 9 (index 2)
     - Swap 10 with 12: `c = {12, 10, 9, 2, 5, 7, 6}`
     - Heapify subtree rooted at index 1:
       - Node: 10
       - Left child: 2 (index 3)
       - Right child: 5 (index 4)
       - Swap 10 with 5: `c = {12, 5, 9, 2, 10, 7, 6}`
       - Heapify subtree rooted at index 4 (no changes needed).

   - The final heap after heapifying is `c = {12, 10, 9, 2, 5, 7, 6}`.

**Output:** `c = {12, 10, 9, 2, 5, 7, 6}`

This process ensures that the combined array is restructured into a valid max heap.
