    }
};
```
### Explanation

The given code is for performing a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a graph. Here's a breakdown of the functions:

1. **`dfs` Function:**
   - This is a recursive function used to perform DFS on the graph.
   - It takes the current node, a `visited` vector to keep track of visited nodes, an `ans` vector to store the traversal result, and an adjacency list `adj[]` representing the graph.
   - The current node is marked as visited, and then added to the result list `ans`.
   - The function iterates over all adjacent nodes of the current node. If an adjacent node hasn't been visited, it recursively calls `dfs` on that node.

2. **`dfsOfGraph` Function:**
   - This function initiates the DFS traversal.
   - It takes the number of vertices `V` and the adjacency list `adj[]` as input.
   - It initializes a `visited` vector to track which nodes have been visited and an `ans` vector to store the DFS traversal order.
   - It starts the DFS traversal from node 0 by calling the `dfs` function.
   - Finally, it returns the `ans` vector containing the DFS traversal.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- The time complexity of the DFS traversal is **O(V + E)**, where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
- Each node is visited exactly once, and each edge is explored once. Hence, the traversal through all nodes and edges results in O(V + E) complexity.

### Space Complexity Analysis

- The space complexity is determined by the `visited` array, the `ans` vector, and the recursion stack used in the DFS function.
- **Visited array:** This takes O(V) space as it stores the visited status of each node.
- **Answer vector:** It also takes O(V) space to store the traversal result.
- **Recursion stack:** In the worst-case scenario (a completely skewed graph), the depth of the recursion can go up to O(V), so the recursion stack space is also O(V).
- Thus, the overall space complexity is **O(V)**.

### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the code using an example graph.

**Graph Representation:**

Consider the following graph with 5 vertices (0 to 4):

```
0 - 1
|   |
4 - 3 - 2
```

The adjacency list representation would be:

```
adj[0] = [1, 4]
adj[1] = [0, 3]
adj[2] = [3]
adj[3] = [1, 2, 4]
adj[4] = [0, 3]
```

**Dry Run Steps:**

1. **Initial State:**
   - `V = 5`
   - `visited = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `ans = []`
   - `adj = [[1, 4], [0, 3], [3], [1, 2, 4], [0, 3]]`

2. **Calling `dfsOfGraph(5, adj)`**:
   - Calls `dfs(0, visited, ans, adj)`
   - `visited = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - `ans = [0]`

3. **Inside `dfs(0, visited, ans, adj)`**:
   - For `it = 1`: `visited[1] = 0`, so calls `dfs(1, visited, ans, adj)`
     - `visited = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`
     - `ans = [0, 1]`
   - Inside `dfs(1, visited, ans, adj)`:
     - For `it = 0`: `visited[0] = 1`, so skip it.
     - For `it = 3`: `visited[3] = 0`, so calls `dfs(3, visited, ans, adj)`
       - `visited = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]`
       - `ans = [0, 1, 3]`
     - Inside `dfs(3, visited, ans, adj)`:
       - For `it = 1`: `visited[1] = 1`, so skip it.
       - For `it = 2`: `visited[2] = 0`, so calls `dfs(2, visited, ans, adj)`
         - `visited = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`
         - `ans = [0, 1, 3, 2]`
       - Inside `dfs(2, visited, ans, adj)`:
         - For `it = 3`: `visited[3] = 1`, so skip it.
       - Exit `dfs(2, visited, ans, adj)`.
       - For `it = 4`: `visited[4] = 0`, so calls `dfs(4, visited, ans, adj)`
         - `visited = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
         - `ans = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]`
       - Inside `dfs(4, visited, ans, adj)`:
         - For `it = 0`: `visited[0] = 1`, so skip it.
         - For `it = 3`: `visited[3] = 1`, so skip it.
       - Exit `dfs(4, visited, ans, adj)`.
     - Exit `dfs(3, visited, ans, adj)`.
   - Exit `dfs(1, visited, ans, adj)`.
   - For `it = 4`: `visited[4] = 1`, so skip it.
   - Exit `dfs(0, visited, ans, adj)`.

4. **Final State:**
   - `ans = [0, 1, 3, 2, 4]` (DFS traversal order)

### Summary

The given implementation correctly performs a DFS traversal of the graph. It starts from the first node (node 0) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. The traversal visits all nodes reachable from the starting node and stores the order in which nodes are visited.
