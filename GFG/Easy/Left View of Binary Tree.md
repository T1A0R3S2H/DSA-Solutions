### Code
```cpp
void dfs(Node* node, int level, vector<int>& res) {
        if(node == NULL) return;
        if(res.size() == level) res.push_back(node->data);
        dfs(node->left, level+1, res);
        dfs(node->right, level+1, res);
}

vector<int> leftView(Node *root) {
        vector<int> res;
        if(root == NULL) return res;
        dfs(root, 0, res);
        return res;
}
```

Let's break down the given code to understand how it works, its time complexity (TC), space complexity (SC), and then perform a dry run on a sample input.

### Explanation

The goal of this code is to find the left view of a binary tree. The left view of a binary tree contains the first node at each level when the tree is viewed from the left side.

#### Function: `dfs`

This is a Depth-First Search (DFS) function that traverses the tree recursively.

- **Parameters:**
  - `node`: The current node being visited.
  - `level`: The current level in the tree.
  - `res`: A reference to a vector that stores the left view nodes.

- **Steps:**
  1. If the current node is `NULL`, return (base case for recursion).
  2. If the size of `res` is equal to the current level, it means we are visiting this level for the first time, so we add the current node's data to `res`.
  3. Recursively call `dfs` on the left child, incrementing the level by 1.
  4. Recursively call `dfs` on the right child, incrementing the level by 1.

#### Function: `leftView`

This function initializes the result vector and calls the `dfs` function.

- **Steps:**
  1. Create an empty vector `res` to store the result.
  2. If the root is `NULL`, return the empty vector.
  3. Call `dfs` with the root node, level 0, and the result vector.
  4. Return the result vector `res`.

### Time Complexity (TC)

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the DFS traversal.

### Space Complexity (SC)

The space complexity of this solution is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the binary tree. This is due to the recursion stack space used by the DFS function. In the worst case, for a skewed tree, the height \(h\) can be \(n\), making the space complexity \(O(n)\).

### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run on a sample binary tree:

```
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \   \
  4   5   6
```

1. **Initial Call:**
   - `leftView(root)` is called.
   - `res` is initialized to an empty vector.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - `dfs(1, 0, res)` is called.
   - `res` is `[1]` after visiting node 1 (level 0).

3. **Left Subtree of Node 1:**
   - `dfs(2, 1, res)` is called.
   - `res` is `[1, 2]` after visiting node 2 (level 1).
   - `dfs(4, 2, res)` is called.
   - `res` is `[1, 2, 4]` after visiting node 4 (level 2).
   - `dfs(NULL, 3, res)` is called (left child of 4), returns immediately.
   - `dfs(NULL, 3, res)` is called (right child of 4), returns immediately.

4. **Right Subtree of Node 2:**
   - `dfs(5, 2, res)` is called.
   - `res` remains `[1, 2, 4]` as level 2 has already been visited.
   - `dfs(NULL, 3, res)` is called (left child of 5), returns immediately.
   - `dfs(NULL, 3, res)` is called (right child of 5), returns immediately.

5. **Right Subtree of Node 1:**
   - `dfs(3, 1, res)` is called.
   - `res` remains `[1, 2, 4]` as level 1 has already been visited.
   - `dfs(NULL, 2, res)` is called (left child of 3), returns immediately.
   - `dfs(6, 2, res)` is called.
   - `res` remains `[1, 2, 4]` as level 2 has already been visited.
   - `dfs(NULL, 3, res)` is called (left child of 6), returns immediately.
   - `dfs(NULL, 3, res)` is called (right child of 6), returns immediately.

6. **Result:**
   - `res` is `[1, 2, 4]`, which is the left view of the tree.

### Summary

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(h)\), worst-case \(O(n)\)
- **Dry Run Result:** For the sample tree, the left view is `[1, 2, 4]`.

This code effectively captures the left view of the binary tree by leveraging DFS and checking the level of nodes as they are visited.
