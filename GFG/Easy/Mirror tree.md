### Code
```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to convert a binary tree into its mirror tree.
    void mirror(Node* node) {
        if (!node) return;
        mirror(node->left); //left subtree
        mirror(node->right); //right subtree
        
        // Swap the left and right children of the current node.
        Node* temp=node->left;
        node->left=node->right;
        node->right=temp;
    }
};
```
### Explanation

The goal of the function is to convert a binary tree into its mirror image. In a mirror image, the left and right children of all non-leaf nodes are swapped.

Here's how the function works:

1. **Base Case**: The function first checks if the current node is `NULL`. If it is, there's nothing to process, and the function returns immediately.

2. **Recursive Calls**: The function makes recursive calls to mirror the left subtree and then the right subtree. These calls continue until all subtrees have been processed.

3. **Swapping**: After both left and right subtrees of the current node have been processed (i.e., mirrored), the function swaps the left and right children of the current node. This step ensures that the current node conforms to the mirror image property.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the traversal.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This accounts for the space used by the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario (skewed tree), this space complexity becomes O(n).

### Dry Run

Let's perform a dry run of the code with a sample binary tree to illustrate how it works. Consider the following binary tree:

```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

After converting this tree to its mirror, it should look like:

```
    1
   / \
  3   2
     / \
    5   4
```

#### Dry Run Steps

1. **Initial Call**: `mirror(root)` is called with `root` pointing to node `1`.
   
2. **Node 1**: 
   - Not `NULL`, so proceed.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the left subtree (`node 2`).

3. **Node 2**:
   - Not `NULL`, so proceed.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the left subtree (`node 4`).

4. **Node 4**:
   - Not `NULL`, so proceed.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the left subtree (which is `NULL`). Return immediately.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the right subtree (which is `NULL`). Return immediately.
   - Swap the left and right children of node `4` (both are `NULL`, so no change).
   - Return to the previous call (node `2`).

5. **Back to Node 2**:
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the right subtree (`node 5`).

6. **Node 5**:
   - Not `NULL`, so proceed.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the left subtree (which is `NULL`). Return immediately.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the right subtree (which is `NULL`). Return immediately.
   - Swap the left and right children of node `5` (both are `NULL`, so no change).
   - Return to the previous call (node `2`).

7. **Back to Node 2**:
   - Now both left (node `4`) and right (node `5`) subtrees are mirrored.
   - Swap the left and right children of node `2`. Now left is `5` and right is `4`.
   - Return to the previous call (node `1`).

8. **Back to Node 1**:
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the right subtree (`node 3`).

9. **Node 3**:
   - Not `NULL`, so proceed.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the left subtree (which is `NULL`). Return immediately.
   - Recursively call `mirror` on the right subtree (which is `NULL`). Return immediately.
   - Swap the left and right children of node `3` (both are `NULL`, so no change).
   - Return to the previous call (node `1`).

10. **Back to Node 1**:
    - Now both left (node `3`) and right (node `2` mirrored) subtrees are mirrored.
    - Swap the left and right children of node `1`. Now left is `3` and right is `2`.

The final mirrored tree is:

```
    1
   / \
  3   2
     / \
    5   4
```

### Summary

- The function effectively mirrors the binary tree by recursively processing the left and right subtrees, then swapping them.
- This approach ensures that all nodes are processed, and their children are swapped correctly to produce the mirror image of the tree.
