### Explanation

1. **Adjacency List Construction**: We start by creating an adjacency list to represent the graph. Each node will store a list of its neighbors.

2. **DFS with Time Tracking**: We use a DFS approach to explore the graph. For each node, we track:
   - `inTime[curr]`: The discovery time of the current node.
   - `lowTime[curr]`: The lowest discovery time reachable from the current node.
   - `visited[curr]`: A boolean to indicate whether the node has been visited.

3. **Finding Critical Connections**: During DFS, for each edge `(curr, neighbour)`:
   - If the `neighbour` is not visited, we recursively perform DFS on it. After returning, we update the `lowTime` of `curr`.
   - If `lowTime[neighbour] > inTime[curr]`, it means that `neighbour` cannot reach back to `curr` or any of its ancestors without using the edge `(curr, neighbour)`, indicating that this edge is a critical connection.

4. **Handling All Nodes**: We initiate DFS from every unvisited node to ensure all components of the graph are covered (handling disconnected graphs).

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: Building the adjacency list takes O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges.
- **DFS Traversal**: Each node and each edge is visited exactly once, which gives O(V + E).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(V + E).

### Space Complexity

- **Adjacency List**: O(V + E) to store the graph.
- **Auxiliary Space**: O(V) for storing `inTime`, `lowTime`, and `visited` arrays.
- **Recursive Stack Space**: O(V) in the worst case for the DFS recursion.
- **Overall Space Complexity**: O(V + E).

### Dry Run (ETSD)

Let's dry-run the code with the given example:

**Input**: `n = 4, connections = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0], [1, 3]]`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `adj` = `[[1], [0, 2, 3], [1, 0], [1]]`
   - `inTime` = `[-1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - `lowTime` = `[-1, -1, -1, -1]`
   - `visited` = `[false, false, false, false]`
   - `timer` = `0`
   - `result` = `[]`

2. **DFS from Node 0**:
   - `visited[0]` = `true`, `inTime[0]` = `0`, `lowTime[0]` = `0`, `timer` = `1`
   - `neighbor = 1` (unvisited): Call DFS for `1`.

3. **DFS from Node 1**:
   - `visited[1]` = `true`, `inTime[1]` = `1`, `lowTime[1]` = `1`, `timer` = `2`
   - `neighbor = 0` (parent, ignore)
   - `neighbor = 2` (unvisited): Call DFS for `2`.

4. **DFS from Node 2**:
   - `visited[2]` = `true`, `inTime[2]` = `2`, `lowTime[2]` = `2`, `timer` = `3`
   - `neighbor = 1` (parent, ignore)
   - `neighbor = 0` (already visited): Update `lowTime[2]` to `min(2, 0)` = `0`.

5. **Back to Node 1**:
   - `lowTime[1]` = `min(1, 0)` = `0`
   - `neighbor = 3` (unvisited): Call DFS for `3`.

6. **DFS from Node 3**:
   - `visited[3]` = `true`, `inTime[3]` = `3`, `lowTime[3]` = `3`, `timer` = `4`
   - `neighbor = 1` (already visited): Update `lowTime[3]` to `min(3, 1)` = `1`.

7. **Back to Node 1**:
   - `lowTime[1]` = `min(0, 1)` = `0`
   - Since `lowTime[3]` > `inTime[1]` (3 > 1), add `[1, 3]` to `result`.

8. **Back to Node 0**:
   - `lowTime[0]` = `min(0, 0)` = `0`

9. **DFS Complete**:
   - `result` = `[[1, 3]]`

The critical connection is `[[1, 3]]`.
