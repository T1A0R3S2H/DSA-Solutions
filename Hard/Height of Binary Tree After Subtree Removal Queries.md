private:
    unordered_map<int, int> heights;        // Stores heights of each subtree

### Explanation

1. **Subtree Height Calculation (`height` function)**:
   - This function calculates the height of each subtree rooted at every node.
   - It performs a post-order traversal, where for each node, it recursively finds the height of its left and right subtrees and stores the maximum of the two plus one in the `heights` map.
   - Caching heights in the `heights` map reduces redundant computations, as each node's height is computed only once and reused where needed.

2. **Max Height Calculation after Subtree Removal (`dfs` function)**:
   - This function determines the maximum possible height of the tree when any subtree is removed, using a depth-first search traversal.
   - `depth` tracks the current depth of traversal, and `maxHeight` keeps the highest height from nodes above the current subtree.
   - For each node:
     - It calculates the maximum height excluding its subtree. If the node has left and right children, it uses the height of the opposite subtree.
     - Stores this maximum height in `resultAfterRemove` for use in queries.
   - This ensures `resultAfterRemove` has the tree's height after removing any specific subtree.

3. **Handling Queries (`treeQueries` function)**:
   - Precomputes heights of each subtree and the maximum height of the tree after removing each subtree.
   - For each query, retrieves the stored height from `resultAfterRemove` and appends it to `res`, which is returned as the final answer.

### Time Complexity

- **`height` function**: `O(n)` because each node is visited once.
- **`dfs` function**: `O(n)` as each node is again visited once, storing precomputed results.
- **Total**: `O(n + m)`, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of queries.

### Space Complexity

- **`heights` and `resultAfterRemove` maps**: `O(n)`, storing heights and max heights after each subtreeâ€™s removal.
- **Recursive Call Stack**: `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree, for the DFS traversal.
- **Total**: `O(n)`

### Detailed dry run

**Tree**: `[5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6]`

```
          5
         / \
        8   9
       / \ / \
      2  1 3  7
     / \
    4   6
```

**Queries**: `[3, 2, 4, 8]`

We'll go through each function with the relevant variables step-by-step.

### Function 1: `height`

The purpose of `height` is to calculate the height of each subtree rooted at every node. The `height` function performs a recursive depth-first traversal, calculating the height of the tree for each node in a post-order manner (left, right, root).

#### Step-by-Step Execution of `height`:

1. **Calculate height of node 4**:
   - `height(4)`: Node `4` has no children, so `height(4) = 1`.
   - Store `heights[4] = 1`.

2. **Calculate height of node 6**:
   - `height(6)`: Node `6` has no children, so `height(6) = 1`.
   - Store `heights[6] = 1`.

3. **Calculate height of node 2**:
   - `height(2)`: Node `2` has left child `4` and right child `6`.
   - `height(2) = 1 + max(height(4), height(6)) = 1 + max(1, 1) = 2`.
   - Store `heights[2] = 2`.

4. **Calculate height of node 1**:
   - `height(1)`: Node `1` has no children, so `height(1) = 1`.
   - Store `heights[1] = 1`.

5. **Calculate height of node 8**:
   - `height(8)`: Node `8` has left child `2` and right child `1`.
   - `height(8) = 1 + max(height(2), height(1)) = 1 + max(2, 1) = 3`.
   - Store `heights[8] = 3`.

6. **Calculate height of node 3**:
   - `height(3)`: Node `3` has no children, so `height(3) = 1`.
   - Store `heights[3] = 1`.

7. **Calculate height of node 7**:
   - `height(7)`: Node `7` has no children, so `height(7) = 1`.
   - Store `heights[7] = 1`.

8. **Calculate height of node 9**:
   - `height(9)`: Node `9` has left child `3` and right child `7`.
   - `height(9) = 1 + max(height(3), height(7)) = 1 + max(1, 1) = 2`.
   - Store `heights[9] = 2`.

9. **Calculate height of root node 5**:
   - `height(5)`: Node `5` has left child `8` and right child `9`.
   - `height(5) = 1 + max(height(8), height(9)) = 1 + max(3, 2) = 4`.
   - Store `heights[5] = 4`.

After `height` function completes, `heights` is:
```plaintext
heights = {4: 1, 6: 1, 2: 2, 1: 1, 8: 3, 3: 1, 7: 1, 9: 2, 5: 4}
```

### Function 2: `dfs`

The `dfs` function calculates the maximum height of the tree after removing each subtree. We start from the root node with `depth = 0` and `maxHeight = 0`, updating `resultAfterRemove` for each node.

#### Step-by-Step Execution of `dfs`:

1. **Process node 5 (root)**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[5] = maxHeight = 0`.
   - Left child: Call `dfs(8, depth = 1, maxHeight = max(0, 0 + height(9)) = 2)`.
   - Right child: Call `dfs(9, depth = 1, maxHeight = max(0, 0 + height(8)) = 3)`.

2. **Process node 8**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[8] = maxHeight = 2`.
   - Left child: Call `dfs(2, depth = 2, maxHeight = max(2, 1 + height(1)) = 2)`.
   - Right child: Call `dfs(1, depth = 2, maxHeight = max(2, 1 + height(2)) = 3)`.

3. **Process node 2**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[2] = maxHeight = 2`.
   - Left child: Call `dfs(4, depth = 3, maxHeight = max(2, 2 + height(6)) = 3)`.
   - Right child: Call `dfs(6, depth = 3, maxHeight = max(2, 2 + height(4)) = 3)`.

4. **Process node 4**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[4] = maxHeight = 3`.
   - Node `4` has no children, so we return.

5. **Process node 6**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[6] = maxHeight = 3`.
   - Node `6` has no children, so we return.

6. **Process node 1**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[1] = maxHeight = 3`.
   - Node `1` has no children, so we return.

7. **Process node 9**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[9] = maxHeight = 3`.
   - Left child: Call `dfs(3, depth = 2, maxHeight = max(3, 1 + height(7)) = 3)`.
   - Right child: Call `dfs(7, depth = 2, maxHeight = max(3, 1 + height(3)) = 3)`.

8. **Process node 3**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[3] = maxHeight = 3`.
   - Node `3` has no children, so we return.

9. **Process node 7**:
   - `resultAfterRemove[7] = maxHeight = 3`.
   - Node `7` has no children, so we return.

After `dfs` function completes, `resultAfterRemove` is:
```plaintext
resultAfterRemove = {5: 0, 8: 2, 2: 2, 1: 3, 4: 3, 6: 3, 9: 3, 3: 3, 7: 3}
```

### Function 3: `treeQueries`

The `treeQueries` function uses the results from `resultAfterRemove` to answer each query by fetching the precomputed heights.

#### Step-by-Step Execution of `treeQueries`:

1. Query `3`: The height of the tree after removing the subtree rooted at `3` is `resultAfterRemove[3] = 3`.
2. Query `2`: The height of the tree after removing the subtree rooted at `2` is `resultAfterRemove[2] = 2`.
3. Query `4`: The height of the tree after removing the subtree rooted at `4` is `resultAfterRemove[4] = 3`.
4. Query `8`: The height of the tree after removing the subtree rooted at `8` is `resultAfterRemove[8] = 2`.

### Final Output

The output for the queries `[3, 2, 4, 8]` is `[3, 2, 3, 2]`.
